[Gurlic](https://gurlic.com) looks interesting:

> Gurlic is an experiment in building a new/old kind of internet community. It is primarily a place for discovering and sharing technology, science, culture and the arts.

Thatâ€™s from the [about page](https://gurlic.com/about), which continues with principles that make for an important and inspiring read. The one about domains stands out:

> Every resource (user, community, publication etc.) must be mappable to custom user-owned domain names.

Basically: even though this is a shared platform, you can bring your own domain and truly own it. 

Via [@liaizon](https://social.wake.st/@liaizon/105806595841973247), whose post also links to a [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24680422). And, Gurlic may be becoming federated via Matrix protocol to be called Hummingbird?
