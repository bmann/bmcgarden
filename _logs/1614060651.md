A good overview of [[Gemini]] by Andrew Roach.

> It’s a protocol partway between gopher and the web, without tracking, with encryption by default, respectful of users above all else.

I like a lot of the principles, and I understand the push back against, shall we say, the “complicated web”. There’s probably some [[content web vs app web]] feelings going on here too.
