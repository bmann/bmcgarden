Thanks to a tip from Jacob, I’m registered for my first dose of vaccine using [TeleHippo](https://telehippo.com/).

Apparently they partnered with BC Pharmacies and got this done.

The form filling worked and got me a booking, so I’m glad it exists. But I shook my head at the “phone numbers only no spaces or dashes” and the two incompatible ways of entering in birthdates.

Along with limited open data and collection timing by the PHO here in BC after 13 months, I really do wish we could have better government digital services.

Meanwhile in California, a volunteer team is working to pull together vaccine availability. Simon Willison just joined the team and talked about [porting from Airtable to Django](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Apr/12/porting-vaccinateca-to-django/). 40M population vs our little 4M population province. Volunteers doing a great job. But still — volunteers!
