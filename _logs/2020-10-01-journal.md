I had just "one more thing" to add to the site last night, and so ended up staying up way too late again.

I'm now trying out [[Obsidian]] for working with these notes. Again, the nice thing about "files" and _some_ commonality around Markdown.

And it generates an impressive looking graph!

It doesn't fully understand Jekyll markdown notes -- I guess the spelling for wiki links has to be exact.

New notes it creates with Title Caps and spaces, which is easy enough to fix before publishing. This not-really-compatible-markdown-and-file-structures is where all the issues live in note portability.

And, funky things like these SJ specific external links [[@obsdmd::https://twitter.com/obsdmd]][[Source for Twitter links looks like this: <code>@obsdmd : : https://twitter.com/obsdmd</code> inside the brackets.::lsn]] it doesn't understand what I'm doing :)

It _is_ a very nice distraction free writing interface that I can see using, but using my code editor as my note taking interface, especiallty when I _am_ going back and forth programming the website with little chunks of [[Liquid]] markup, probably makes more sense for me.
