I have to do some more [[Webfinger]] research.

I added a file to this site at [.well-known/webfinger](/.well-known/webfinger) to try out delegating a [[remotestorage]] account, and it worked!

More details [on the Fission forum](https://talk.fission.codes/t/kommit-fission-integration/1634/12), working with @rosano.

What else speaks Webfinger and can be delegated like this? Itâ€™s very [[IndieWeb]] feeling.
