I posted the [[Back to IndieKit]] blog to Mastodon.

I’m thinking about automating posts from this journal to Mastodon. The people there are likely interested in the type of stuff I post about. I would need to build a [[JSON Feed]] and then I can use my existing [[Micro.blog]] subscription to cross post.

Hmmm. Since the [[Revue]] newsletter builder is part of Twitter now, and I looked at using it for Fission, maybe I’ll put the Journal feed into there, that could be interesting.
