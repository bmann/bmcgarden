I'm spending some time working on [[Moa Party]] today.

I created a new [[Mastodon]] account for the project to complete the setup of all of the social accounts for the project. We were thinking that we might run our own Mastodon server at some point, but accounts can be moved pretty easily within Mastodon, so I went ahead and chose the [[Fosstodon]] server to create an account on.

From the [Fosstodon about page](https://hub.fosstodon.org/about/), "a community of like-minded people who enjoy Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)", plus they have a sustainability model of passing donations on to other open source projects after costs are covered.

You can follow Moa Party at [@moaparty@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@moaparty).
