[Peter Clark @plc asks](https://twitter.com/plc/status/1378928541962706950):
> I really want a simple, thoughtfully private, not owned by a tech conglomerate, photo sharing app that is really nicely designed. like instagram in 2010. does this exist?

I answered with links to [[Micro.blog]] and the [[Sunlit]] client and [[ActivityPub]] powered [[Pixelfed]].

I think Pixelfed is probably the strongest foundation, with the bonus that you could pull in [[Mastodon]] and other ActivityPub content that included photos for a broader network. 

I’ve talked to some artists and for them it’s about other inspiring artists on the platform and... people who buy the work they post. 

Some social networks — like art or styles of photos — simply aren’t niche, so where do network effects come from? How do we get started?
