OK, I clicked the buttons and made what I think are all my final purchases for my Mac Mini, other than external storage.

But first: I bought an [[Asus VG289Q Monitor]] at Best Buy earlier this week. Got it home and the screen wouldn't stay on?

At first I thought the wimpy Mac Mini maybe couldn't drive it through HDMI and I needed a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter, but those adapters don't really exist. I looked around and the various HDMI cables now do have different "ratings" on them. I bought a short gold plated HDMI cable and yes! -- the monitor works fine.

I looked back and forth at various [[eGPU]] options. I decided the Razer Core X Chroma was the best enclosure for me. I plan on using it for both Windows and Mac over time, and as an external enclosure it's even possible to upgrade the video card.

I did [read through the Bootcamp for eGPUs](https://egpu.io/boot-camp-egpu-setup-guide/) but I don't think I will attempt Bootcamp. Who knows how much longer it will be around / keep working as Apple transitions to ARM.

Looking at the [EGPU.io builds filter](https://egpu.io/best-external-graphics-card-builds/) with a Mac Mini and the Razer Core X Chroma selected helped me pick the graphics card to buy. There were only 2 Mac Mini builds listed, both using an AMD RX 5700 XT. I debated about getting a cheaper card, but I'd rather finish off my purchases now.

Then I was back in graphic card comparison hell, because the AMD RX 5700 XT is just a chipset 
(I guess???) and many different manufacturers put together the final cards.

I ended up with [PowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT 8GB AXRX 5700XT 8GBD6-3DHE/OC](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07WP6TYQ3/), for $611CAD. No, I don't even totally understand what that means.

Hopeful that this [Kingsdun Torx Screwdriver Set](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00MUJU33S/) has what I need.

And ended up with a [Vitade 1080p webcam with ring light](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07RRZQBRN/) as well.

I did experiment with [[Camo]] by [Reincubate](https://reincubate.com/camo/) to use my iPhone as a webcam. I have an iPhone / iPad stand clamped to my desk, and it does work -- and with very good quality! But it's not like I can keep my iPhone clamped in there all the time.
