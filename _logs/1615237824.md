I got invited to [[Simon Wardley]]’s every two week “interesting people” video chat. Lots of discussion around [[Wardley Maps]], a bit of [[serverless]] thrown in. An interesting group of people. Some have tracked me down on either LinkedIn or Twitter.

For the next call, the suggested topic is to look at applying mapping to health / healthcare. 

This connects directly to @tonzylstra’s recent post [It’s more logical to host an event than attend one](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2021/03/its-more-logical-to-host-an-event-than-attend-one/).
