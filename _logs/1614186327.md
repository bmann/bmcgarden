Woo hoo! I am so stoked!

I now have this site auto-publishing using [[Github Actions for Jekyll]], with a [[Fission Publish]] Github Action at the end.

I used the [nicely commented limjh16/jekyll-action-ts](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts/blob/master/.github/workflows/workflow.yml) and then just added fission publish at the end.
