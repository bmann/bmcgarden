Via [Roland](http://rolandtanglao.com/2021/02/23/p1-tom-macwright-one-way-to-represent-things-like-r-dataframe-python-pandas-spreadsheet-cells/), Tom MacWright wonders if the future of programming is [more common data types](https://macwright.com/2021/02/23/one-way-to-represent-things.html):

> What if a simpler programming language had first-class representations of a lot more than strings and arrays?

> But if the aim is ease of use and giving power to people who otherwise wouldn’t be doing programming, type-rich systems with lots of assumptions seem like a logical first step. And one that doesn’t need a visual editor or a new dialect of a rare programming language.
