Looking at recipe formats again because @icidasset was asking what the best apps are. I’ve never found one I like for a variety of reasons. 

[Paprika Recipe Manager](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) was the one that most people recommended. 

Google has this [JSON-LD format for structured recipe data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe). As well as rich search results, it can be used by “assistants” to read out by voice.
