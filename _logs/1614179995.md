[Helder is starting a public monologue channel on the Fission Discourse](https://talk.fission.codes/t/helder-monologue/1606). Monologue channels are something we developed for Fission’s internal Discord chat spaces that seem to have worked out well for people, so Helder is trying it in public. 

It’s been fun to evolve how we work as a distributed team.
