[Brave Browser bought a search engine](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/03/brave_buys_a_search_engine/), “promises no tracking, no profiling – and may even offer a paid-for, no-ad version”.

Good timing for clearing my tabs of other [[Brave]] related stuff. This [PDF white paper describes the Brave Search Team’s plans](https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf) — [[Goggles]]:

> This paper proposes an open and collaborative system by which a community, or a single user, can create sets of rules and filters, called Goggles, to define the space which a search engine can pull results from. Instead of a single ranking algorithm, we could have as many as needed, overcoming the biases that a single actor (the search engine) embeds into the results.
