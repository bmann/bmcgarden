[Internet Connectivity Working Group](https://www.bowenislandmunicipality.ca/internet-connectivity-working-group) at the [[Bowen Island]] Municipality from 2016.

There's a discussion about [community economic development on Bowen Island going on](https://bowenisland.citizenlab.co/en/projects/ced), and I submitted the suggestion of a [Community ISP](https://bowenisland.citizenlab.co/en/ideas/community-isp).

I think this could be done via a mix of 5G towers and wireless.
