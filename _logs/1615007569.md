[[Codex]] [^agoralinks] is one of a number of note taking [[tools for thought]] that I’ve been following on [Twitter @codexeditor](https://twitter.com/codexeditor).

I hadn’t realized that the [Codex Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor) was the main web presence other than the Twitter account. It’s actually great to see so many digital creators getting supported directly to build. 

[^agoralinks]: Which I’m going to have to figure out how to link to the [[Agora]] node that [@flancian made](https://anagora.org/node/codex). I should probably make an [[Agora FAQ]] page.
