Chatting with @flancian who was wondering if he should support the [[Simply Jekyll]] margin note syntax in [[Anagora]].

Specifically “what do you call this freak of nature???” when he saw the markup 😅

I’ll do a search and replace at some point to convert everything to [[Littlefoot]] which is probably worth a write up [[TO DO]] [[Implementing Littlefoot for footnotes]]. 

The install was completed right at the [end of my birthday](https://bmannconsulting.com/log/1614067195/).
