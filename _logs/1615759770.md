I'm exploring [[SSG]]s again, and trying out [[GitLab Pages]] for the first time. Now that I'm helping to run [[Moa Party]], I'm going to make a static site for it, for status updates and documentation and so on.

[[Hugo]] I've used a bit, because [[Micro.blog]] uses it, so to make a custom theme, I installed it locally for testing.

[[Zola]] is a [[Rust]]-based SSG. I haven't really had any personal experience with Rust, but I'm very interested in it, especially because Rust is very commonly used to compile to [[WebAssembly]].

There is a page [documenting Zola with GitLab pages](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/gitlab-pages/). The mention of git submodules is not comforting.[^gitsub]

[^gitsub]: Everyone, including myself, thinks that git submodules is a good idea, until actually working with them in practice for any period of time.

OK, Zola experiment over. I used the [Juice theme](https://juice.huhu.io) and got Zola running and it is nice and fast. But -- I want to maintain this as a docs site using [[wikilinks]], likely also being compatible with [[Obsidian]] as an editor. I know [[Jekyll]] best so I'll just use that.
