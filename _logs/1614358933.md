I’m having one of those days. Reserved a car from Avis. Show up at 8am. I have a paper temporary driver’s license because I just renewed it. “Policy” is to have picture ID, even though I’m on file, I always rent from this location, and the desk clerk and manager both recognize me. So: do I complete this rental and then never rent from Avis again, after 20 years? Probably. It’s policy after all.
