I keep looking at [[Microlink]] so I guess I should at least post a quick journal log before I write it up more:

From the [home page](https://microlink.io/):
> Browser as API
> Fast, scalable, and reliable browser automation built for businesses and developers. Proudly open source.

You can turn websites into structured data, take screenshots, turn pages into PDFs, and more. Power embeds, etc 

The list of [open source components](https://microlink.io/oss) is super interesting.
