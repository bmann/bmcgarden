Just prepaid for a year of [Beeper](https://beeperhq.com). This is letting me "jump the line" and get into the beta. Plus, I reserved my username as `@boris` there. It is supposed to connect all your messaging apps in one "app" -- even iMessage on non-Apple systems, through a jail broken iPhone.

I really do have the need for a unified messaging app. I'm not super interested in a proprietary paid service to do it, but I'd like to try it out.
