I have been sharing a number of @genmon’s posts from his blog. Mostly, I just say, you should go read this: [Let’s invent new interfaces, not new products](http://interconnected.org/home/2021/02/25/pagers).

Yes I will read anything which links to [[Brett Victor]] and his [[Dynamicland]] project:

> a physical environment of smart light, human writeable code, and a social interaction with the computer.

I can already tell that having this box be able to teleport into my journal log — without having to cross post it publicly — is going to make me both post more, and tweet less. 

Maybe I’ll consider cross posting these [[Journal]] posts to Mastodon.
