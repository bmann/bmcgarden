Main thing I need to do to [complete the rollout of these new journal logs](https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden/issues/2) -- other than pagination -- is to truncate long posts and strip HTML from them.

For short posts, I should not truncate, and actually render markdown.

Probably something like, if the content is bigger than 500 characters, `strip_html` and show 250 chars with a read more link. If less than 500, display the content.

For reference, this post is about 480 characters without HTML tags.
