Major surgery on the site, nicely celebrated from almost 24 hours ago :) Yes, working on my blog on my birthday has got to be tradition by now.

What _was_ Journals all got dumped into logs. Which is a collection in [[Jekyll]] but I'm going to call them all Journals: more granular daily notes and bookmark postings via [[IndieKit]]. The Journal page groups things by day.

Somewhere in there, implemented [[Littlefoot]] for footnotes, and will mostly remove the [[Simply Jekyll]] specific syntax for margin notes, except for design reasons like the home page.
