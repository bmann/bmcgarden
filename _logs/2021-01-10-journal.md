Doing some work on the [[Marfa Theme]] for my [[Micro.blog]] site. Running [[Hugo]] locally is really fast! I still have about 200 orphaned posts that I'd like to import into Mb at some point, which I use for testing, and with Hugo it's pretty instantaneous.

I'm stuck in the dark with Hugo a little bit, as I can't prototype locally because how to structure this for Mb isn't really documented. I guess I'll file another issue in the help documentation, as the only public place you can kind of file this stuff. I really wish Manton would just open source the whole thing or more properly make it non-commercial / source available.
