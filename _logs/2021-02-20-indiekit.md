I decided that remote publishing of notes would be useful. So, back to setting up [[IndieKit]]. It has changed quite a bit since I last looked at it -- for the better!

The actual server you deploy into [[Heroku]] is one index.js file. Here's mine [bmann/indiekit-bmcgarden](https://github.com/bmann/indiekit-bmcgarden), which in turn is really just a copy of [paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit).

I deleted everything except for Articles (which should turn into blog posts) and Notes (which will be notes, as long as notes don't have an arbitrary character limit coming in). I need to figure out templating to do things like turn Bookmarks into notes with the `link:` front matter filled out.
