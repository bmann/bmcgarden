Hi! This is Boris Mann's ðŸŒ± Digital Notes Garden ðŸŒ±!

---

This is my space for Notes[[Yes, basically a personal wiki, although becoming known as a <a href="../secondbrain/">Second Brain</a>::lsn]], saving and highlighting Articles and other Links[[My general rule is that if I share an Article or a Link with two people, I should capture it as a local note.::rmn]].

I've continued to keep my long term Archive around. Any longer posts I make will go here, although mainly that is daily Journal notes.

I am microblogging with my [[Micro.blog]]-hosted site at [microblog.bmannconsulting.com](https://microblog.bmannconsulting.com), which cross-posts a lot of the posts to [[@bmann::https://twitter.com/bmann]].

The [[Colophon]] and [[Garden and the Gazebo]] notes go into the making of the site[[Jekyll with <a href="../simply-jekyll/">Simply Jekyll</a> theme, hosted on Fission::rsn]] and how I use it.

You can browse current and past [[Projects]]. These are mainly small [[Vancouver]] focused things, I'm pretty busy as the founder of [[Fission]].

Starting with the [[Startup]] note, there are various recommendations, products, and recommendations to explore.

If I haven't sent it to you already, you should read [[When Tailwinds Vanish: The Internet in the 2020s]].
