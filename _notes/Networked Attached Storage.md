	- > a file-level (as opposed to [block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage)) computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. The term "NAS" can refer to both the technology and systems involved, or a specialized device built for such functionality (as unlike tangentially related technologies such as local area networks, a NAS device is often a singular unit).
