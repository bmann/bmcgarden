Open, edit, and save TiddlyWiki single file wikis on iOS.

Works with files stored in any files Location available on iOS, including files Locations provided by cloud services.

The simple default option is to use iCloud Drive to be able to edit on your mobile device(s) as well as on desktop MacOS.

I use it with git via [[Working Copy]] to work with my [[FoodWiki]].

The name is from the computing term:

> A **quine** is a [computer program](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") that takes no input and produces a copy of its own [source code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the [computability theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory "Computability theory")and [computer science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

TiddlyWiki itself is a quine.
