> The three components I’ve laid out — Audience, Community, and Product — comprise the funnel for building a business in 2023. I call it the **ACP Funnel.**
> 
> **Audience:** bring people into the stories you’re telling

> **Community:** create a space for people who love your stories and identify with your brand
> 
> **Product:** give your community a product to achieve their goal and improve their own story
