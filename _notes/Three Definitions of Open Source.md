**Open Source as Legal Innovation:** the creation of licenses that enabled source code to be open, including copy left which forced contribution of changes.[^licensing]

**Open Source as Collaboration Method:** the process of working out in the open with a distributed group of contributors jointly making changes to a central code base.[^peer]

**Open Source as Ethos**: a belief that code should be open for inspection and free as in freedom. That code that runs applications should be available and changeable. That many eyes make all bugs shallow.
