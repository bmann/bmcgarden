[Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/) let's you use your iOS device as a webcam for your Mac. You run an app on your phone or iPad, and another app on your Mac, and can then use the front or back camera as video input camera in any app that supports cameras on Mac.

So far I've used it with [[Zoom]] and with [[Discord]] without issues. Discord, being an Electron app, needs a fix applied, which Camo will do for you with your admin password.
