	- My personal Twitter Archive -- everything posted to [my @bmann Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bmann) -- is at <https://tweets.bmannconsulting.com>.
	- It is powered by TAGS aka [[Twitter Archiving Google Sheet]]
	- I set it up a long time ago, and it has worked reliably ever since. It runs from my Google Account, is linked to my Twitter account to pull my [[Twitter/Archive]], and then it publishes it to my Github account, which uses Github Pages to publish and host <https://tweets.bmannconsulting.com>.
	- Martin's post [[Keeping your Twitter Archive fresh and freely hosted on Github Pages]] has all the instructions to set this up for yourself.
