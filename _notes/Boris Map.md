I made a map called "Boris Starred" using [[Facilmap]] and changed the read-only link to <https://facilmap.org/boris>.

It has a Starred layer, and a [[FoodWiki]] layer.

I'd need to break those into two different maps if I wanted to give different people collaborative access to it.

The embedded map includes the location hash so it's centered around Vancouver.
