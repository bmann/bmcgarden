		- 32GB of RAM [ordered from OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/2666DDR4S32P/); the saga of the screwdrivers means that I didn't complete installation until [Feb 2021](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/2021/02/09/i-bought-this.html)
- I have often used Norse Mythology as a naming scheme for computers, although I'm also currently using a Pokemon theme for portable devices. This current Mac Mini is named _Utgard_.[^utgard]
