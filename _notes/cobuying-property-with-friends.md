The entire [Supernuclear Substack](https://supernuclear.substack.com/) is a guide to [[coliving]]:

This article was a really comprehensive overview. Some of it is US centric -- both corporate structures and real-estate specific items around investing are different in Canada -- but I feel a lot more informed about the process and how to think about some of these concepts.

We're at the very beginning of this with [[Vancouver CLT]] in gathering some interested people.
