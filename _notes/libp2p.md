> **lib**p2p is a modular networking framework bundled together as a full stack of protocols for peer-to-peer systems. It is the product of a long and arduous quest into the internet's network stack and all of the plentiful peer-to-peer protocols of the past. Building large-scale peer-to-peer systems has been complex and challenging in the last twenty years and **lib**p2p is a way to fix that. It is a "network stack"—a protocol suite—that cleanly separates concerns and enables sophisticated applications to use only the protocols they need without giving up interoperability and upgradeability. **lib**p2p grew out of [[IPFS]] into an independent project designed to give any project _state-of-the-art_ peer-to-peer capabilities.
