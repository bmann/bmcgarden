Polar is a funding & monetization platform for open source & indie developers.

It uses [[Stripe]] and deep integration into Github to fund individual issues, sell subscriptions and sponsorships, and automate access to private Github repos, Discord servers, and more.

## Testing

You can find my creator page at [polar.sh/bmann](https://polar.sh/bmann)

I'm experimenting with Polar for a couple of "from scratch" open source projects:

* [[11ty Second Brain]]
* [[PDS Twitter Archive]] (not really setup yet)
