Community Search Engines is the label for a set of approaches to interconnect communities. 

These communities are formed by:

* Events such as conferences
* Digital spaces, such as a Discord server

These are often communities of interest, but can also considered to be trust relationships: if you are connected to a group of people you may extend trust to other recommendations they make.

## Reading 

[[Dark Forest and Cozy Web]]

[[The Brazilianization of the Internet]]: forming communities, which can be considered a kind of commons, do exclude or make [[cozyweb]] spaces. Does this cause a kind of elitism, and/or further deteriorate public spaces?
## Tools

[[Lieu]] is an example of some code that helps build community search engines and webrings.
