[[Heroku]] has a "Deploy to Heroku" button that lets people deploy apps using just a browser and the Heroku dashboard.

The two base requirements are that the source code is on [[Github]] and that it contains an `app.json` file.
* `app.json` schema is [documented in the Heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema)
