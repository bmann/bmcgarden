> Chad Whitacre got his start in Open Source in 2001. He participated in the Python web development boom of the 2000s that gave rise to Django and Flask (his own contribution was [Aspen](https://aspen.io/)). Along the way, he experienced first-hand the tension between volunteer Open Source work and paid closed source work, so he spent the 2010s as founder of a crowdfunding startup called [Gittip (later Gratipay)](https://gratipay.com/). Now here in the 2020s his role is Head of Open Source at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), an application monitoring company with deep roots in the Open Source community. He blogs at [Open Path](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/).
