	- Even in this serverless world, the act of programming still requires you to think about what component services need to be glued together. That means you have to break down the problem into components, find component services that match, determine what is missing and hence what you will need to build, then build it and glue it all together. That is still a lot of work to be done and to be blunt, it’s work that can mostly be automated and achieved through some form of intelligent compiler. This leads us to conversational programming.
	- …programming will start to look more like a conversation between an engineer with an AI making recommendations for changes and addition of services. If you wish to see the future then a wondeful example of conversational programming can be found in the marvellous StarTrek Voyager and the [“Delete the wife”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNCybqmKugA) scene.
	- I want you take a moment to think about this. The speed of one company with engineers building systems through conversational programming (i.e. a discussion with the system) versus the speed of a company whose engineers are messing around with containers and orchestration systems (such as kubernetes clusters) versus the speed of a company whose engineers are still wiring servers in racks. I want you to think about the Red Queen effect and realise that you will have no choice over this evolution.
	- the main platform principles needed are build discrete components, build WITH discrete components and shift as much of the platform to utility providers.
