Links your [[Mastodon]] account to [[Twitter]] to enable cross-posting in both directions.

@flancian and I have formed a squad under the [[FedStoa]] to run Moa as a public utility. The home base for this is now on Gitlab at <https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/moa>. The issue queue in that repo is where TODOs are actively being tracked.

The Matrix channel [#moaparty:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/!zPwMsygFdoMjtdrDfo:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) is where chat discussion is happening. Add #moaparty to your Twitter, Instagram, or Mastodon posts, or the `[[Moa Party]]` wikilink.

Features
* [[Git Siphon for Moa Party]]
* [[Roam Siphon for Moa Party]]
* [[Micropub endpoint for Moa Party]]

## To Do

Create a Mastodon account, pick a home server for Moa Party, maybe `mastodon.social`?
* In the future, we may very well want to run a Mastodon server of our own for various experimental things for [[FedStoa]]

Create a "Wikilinks Support" open collective goal
* initially this will post [[wikilink]] content to a Git repo as a Daily Logo
* Need to write up [[Git Siphon for Moa Party]] feature

Write up a blog post announcing Moa as a public utility

Create a "Roam Support" open collective goal
* do this later, once we have Instagram and the Git siphon underway
## Done

Created a Twitter account [@moaparty](https://twitter.com/moaparty)

Created an Instagram account [@moa.party](https://instagram.com/moa.party)
* Without the period is taken

Created an [[Open Collective]] at <https://opencollective.com/moa>, which is under the [[Fission]] Fiscal Host.
* created monthly and annual "Happy Poster" backer levels 
* created a "Bring back Instagram" goal of $1000CAD -- more than this? Boris intends to contribute at least $500 to get it started

Created a FedStoa org on Github
* https://github.com/FedStoa
* plan is to move the original github repo there when transferred, and set it up as a mirror of the Gitlab source

As of September 2020, Instagram cross posting is disabled because of changes in the Instagram API. Likely same reason that [[OwnYourGram]] doesn't really work anymore.
