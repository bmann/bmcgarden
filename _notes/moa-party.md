Links your [[Mastodon]] account to [[Twitter]] to enable cross-posting in both directions.

@flancian, @vera and I have formed a squad under the [[FedStoa]] to run Moa as a public utility. The home base for this is now on Gitlab at <https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/moa>. The issue queue in that repo is where TODOs are actively being tracked.

The [moaparty.com](https://moaparty.com) website is the status / news / docs website for the project, with the source code and build on Gitlab under the [[FedStoa]] group.

The Matrix channel [#moaparty:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/!zPwMsygFdoMjtdrDfo:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) is where chat discussion is happening. Add #moaparty to your Twitter, Instagram, or Mastodon posts, or the `[[Moa Party]]` wikilink.

As of September 2020, Instagram cross posting is disabled because of changes in the Instagram API. Likely same reason that [[OwnYourGram]] doesn't really work anymore.
