- A keynote at [[Northern Voice]] 2012 by [[Blaine Cook]]
- Original talk description
	- The internet is a huge social experiment, one that's already had a massive impact on all aspects of our society. While we're only just beginning, the amount of work happening today is incredible, and setting the scene for the future. If, as William Gibson suggests, the present provides all the elements for good science fiction, then the question is how are we setting the scene for a more incredible future?

	- **Bio**
	- Blaine is a BC-bred, now London-based sociotechnologist, a hacker dissatisfied by simply building software. His long-term obsession is fostering anarchic networks as a counter-point to the centralised systems that have come to dominate the web over the past decade. Through numerous collaborations, he has developed protocols and concepts that are forming the basis for many social internet technologies yet to come. His past work as the founding architect of Twitter has seen broad adoption both culturally and technologically. He is currently working on a new venture to bring simple community-building tools to independent poetry and short story publishers and writers of the world with his partner, author and poet Maureen Evans.

	- > Saturday dawned bright and early with [Blaine Cook’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Cook_%28programmer%29) wonderful keynote, celebrating diversity in culture, life, and technology platforms in the face of globalisation and market forces. He tied together architecture, rainforest, and people fighting to save their culture with the domination by large platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to encourage diversity and independence.

	- > Back in 2005 when a group of volunteers pulled together Canada’s first weblogging conference, social media was just beginning. YouTube was launched the same year, Facebook was still the domain of students and from Twitter, there wasn’t yet a peep.
	- > Among the speakers is Blaine Cook, a founding architect of Twitter
