I'm going to use the term Local AI to refer to a wide group of subjects. Some of it is local model training, some of it is local inference, some of it is decentralized compute.

And, local in the sense of local, geographic areas.

## How can local communities use AI?

Is this connected to the [[DWeb]] movement and principles?
