I'm going to use the term Local AI to refer to a wide group of subjects. Some of it is local model training, some of it is local inference, some of it is decentralized compute.

And, local in the sense of local, geographic areas.

This is different than [[on device AI]] which is a narrower term that means AI running locally on laptops, smartphones, and other edge devices. 

## How can local communities use AI?

Is this connected to the [[DWeb]] movement and principles?
