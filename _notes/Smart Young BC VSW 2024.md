Part of [[Vancouver Startup Week]] 2024

​[[Ian Vanagas]] is the host of [[Smart Young BC]], a vision for and discussion about the future of BC. His core premise is that a strong indicator of success for our region is if **smart young people are moving here and staying here**.

​10 years ago, Boris Mannhelped organize the first Vancouver Startup Week. What has changed in 10 years? What's still left to work on? How do we work together to grow our city, our province, and our country?

​Join us for a discussion and call to action of how we make this a reality.

​_Note: we have venue and provisional time. Please register to save the date, we'll have final details and tickets as the VSW schedule is announced._
