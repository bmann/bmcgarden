	- That dark forest is about to expand. [[Large Language Models]] (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party.
	  
	  Over the last six months, we've seen a flood of LLM copywriting and content-generation products come out: [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/), [Moonbeam](https://www.gomoonbeam.com/), [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/), and [Anyword](https://anyword.com/) are just a few. They're designed to pump out advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages. And they'reÂ *really*good at it.
