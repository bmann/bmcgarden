> Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.
> 
> Ubicloud provides IaaS cloud features on bare metal providers, such as Hetzner, OVH, and AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself on these providers or you can use our managed service. We're currently in public beta.

I’d put this in my [[Bring Your Own Server]] category. You run this on bare metal servers of your choice, or use Ubicloud’s hosted service. 

Currently using Hetzner servers in Germany.
