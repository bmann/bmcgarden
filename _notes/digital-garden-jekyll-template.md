title: Digital Garden Jekyll Template

This site started with this [[Jekyll]] template, created by [[Maxime Vaillancourt]]. The [[Colophon]] has more details about how it has evolved.

Below, the contents of the original "Your first seed" note, which I deleted along with cats and consistency:

### Welcome!

This is your first note. You'll find it in the [`notes/`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_notes) directory.

### Link syntax

To link to another note, you can use regular [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a link to a note about cats](/cats){: .internal-link}. Don't forget to use the `.internal-link` class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link.

> Note: I'm running GitHub flavoured CommonMark here, so you can also just paste in bare links and they will link automatically

Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: <a class="internal-link" href="/cats">This is the same note about cats as above</a>.

Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: [this is a link to Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/). Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer.

Additionally, you can use Roam/wiki-style link syntax by wrapping a note's title in double brackets, like this: [[Colophon]]. If the Roam-style link does not point to a valid note's title, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[There is no note with this title]].

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[Colophon]]

### Images

Finally, you can display images using Markdown syntax, like this:

![]({{page.image}})
