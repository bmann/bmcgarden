Littlefoot is a [[JavaScript]] library to make great inline footnotes. It's a non-jQuery replacement for [[BigfootJS]].

From the [Github README](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot):
>littlefoot is a lightweight JavaScript library that creates exceptional footnotes. It was forked from Bigfoot.js by Chris SauvÃ© and does not require jQuery.
>
>Simply include the code on your pages and footnotes will be detected automatically and improved in the following ways:
>
>* Links to footnotes will be replaced with clickable/tappable buttons, making them substantially easier to hit.
>
>* Footnote content will appear in a popover directly beside the footnote button when it is clicked/tapped, which cuts out the annoying bouncing around the page that footnotes typically result in.
>
>* The active popovers will be resized and repositioned to ensure that they continue to be completely visible on-screen and aesthetically pleasing: this makes it perfect for mobile devices and responsive designs.
>
>* Supports the markup generated by MultiMarkdown by default.
