p2panda is a protocol for local-first applications

> The core or p2panda is built in Rust from which we also compile WebAssembly for TypeScript developers but we hope to support even more languages one day. For this we formulated a p2panda _specification_ which is some sort of agreement developers can follow so different p2panda _implementations_ can still understand each other.
