This is the label for the tag / set of concepts I mean when thinking about the evolution of venture investment.

I’m not going to stop recommending [[When Tailwinds Vanish]] as a baseline in thinking about the types of businesses that get funded when “is a digital business” or “uses technology” is ubiquitous. 

[[Venture Sized Business]] is a specific thing, in part because of the default business model of venture capital. 

[[IndieVC]] has been inspiring for a long time, and is kicking off again. 

The concept of the [[Venture Studio]], adjacent to [[Accelerator]] models, deserves exploration. [[Kite]] is one local to Vancouver that I’m having some discussions with.

[[Commons Funding]] of all kinds isn’t venture, but lives in the same universe of capital and investment. How to fund [[Open Source]] increasingly does end up in the venture realm.
