> The problem with the term open source is that everyone means something different when they use it. Some people just mean licensing. Some people think of a particular communityâ€™s set of practices. Others think that it means some kind of fuzzy democracy and mob rule.

> In this paper I explain that while free software is highly visible, it is in fact only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon. I suggest that we are seeing is the broad and deep emergence of a new, third mode of production in the digitally networked environment. <mark>I call this mode "commons-based peer-production," to distinguish it from the property- and contract-based models of firms and markets. Its central characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals, rather than either market prices or managerial commands.</mark>
