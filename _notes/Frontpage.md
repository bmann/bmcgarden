Frontpage is a link aggregator — a social network built around aggregating links, upvoting them, and discussing them. 

Hacker News and Reddit are two examples of social network platforms that use links as their core social object.

It’s a little bit different than the older concept of social bookmarking — eg Delicious — but building on top of Frontpage you could also have a front end that feels like that sort of system.
