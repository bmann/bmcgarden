> I am a Canadian biophysicist, entrepreneur, and a Vanier Scholar. I hold a PhD from the University of Ottawa in nanoscale biophysics, and I’ve spent about 10 years as n academic researcher and 4 years as CEO of Northern Nanopore Instruments, a recently-acquired nanotechnology company that my colleagues and I spun out of our research. Currently, I have a foot in both academia and entrepreneurship, and I’m involved in the startup community as a mentor and advisor focused on supporting companies navigate the valley of death between academic research and early commercial operations.

EIR at University of Ottawa.
