## Namecheap Reboot

Spaceship is actually [[Namecheap]], but under a new brand and new codebase. Here's [Richard Kirkendall, Namecheap's CEO, with an April 2024 Twitter post](https://x.com/NamecheapCEO/status/1776484212629004385):

> Hey [@levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio), thanks for asking. Namecheap has always been a 100% privately owned boot strapped company. Growth is good with 330 million in revenue last year and 15% yoy growth.
> 
> Regarding Spaceship, we wanted to start building our next phase without any legacy limitations and a legacy codebase. We also came in with the mindset of what we would do if we wanted to disrupt ourselves.
> 
> Yes, right now the choices in what we offer are similar but it's early. Although I'd argue our UX and experience levels beyond a typical registrar even at this point and the plan is just to keep getting better.
> 
> We are being very deliberate and customer centered around next steps. [https://spaceship.com/roadmap/](https://t.co/ZxD8BKXO4o) . We also want to operate like a start up and move as fast as we can and legacy just wouldn't allow us to do it.
> 
> Someone else mentioned the issues and limitations with our current brand and we want to try and move beyond that and I think we're on the right track.
> 
> We aren't trying to charge more. We are just trying to build something better as a whole, we'll see if works but I believe it will.
> 
> Happy to answer any questions from you or anyone else.
