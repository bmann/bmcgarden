## Specification

> The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol or atproto) is a generic federated protocol for building open social media applications. Some recurring themes and features are:
> 
> - self-authenticating data and identity, allowing seamless account migrations and redistribution of content
> - design for "big world" use cases, scaling to billions of accounts
> - delegated authority over application-layer schemas and aggregation infrastructure
> - re-use of existing data models from the dweb protocol family and network primitives from the web platform
