The collectively owned music marketplace

[Launched October 17th](https://x.com/subvertworld/status/1846926956421697559) with founding co-op memberships for supporters for $100USD (I bought one), and free for musicians and labels to claim.

The launch zine is the **Plan for the Artist-Owned Internet** - "own and control the next bandcamp"

> Bandcamp's corporate acquisitions threaten independent music. It's time for a new model - one we collectively own and control.  
>  
> Our zine outlines how we'll turn our vision of a collectively owned Bandcamp successor into a reality.
