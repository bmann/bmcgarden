[[Simon Wardley]] very clearly shows [[How Organizations Are Changing]] in a 2021 survey and analysis, with many "networked" organizational styles emerging.

Open source communities, platform ecosystems, regional collaboration, and the [[Venture Studio]] model are all examples of systems that benefit from thinking about them as networked organizations.

Tooling and communication needs to reflect the nature of these orgs. They aren't one company or entity, they need a high measure of asynchronous communications, and ownership / permissions need to reflect organizational, working group, and other boundaries, with a variety of access permissions from fully public to network-only to group-only. Formation of groups needs to be fluid across orgs.
