The [[CANARIE]] network is a high speed research network connecting academic institutions and some accelerators. It previously featured physical servers for usage by Canadians, but now hands out AWS credits.

What if we expanded a Canada-based high speed network (10Gbps+) and had people install and run servers in a very decentralized way?

e.g. Mac Studio clusters

## Expanding a High Speed Network

### Vancouver

We've now got a "standard" business connection from TELUS at [[Z-Space]] that is 3Gbps symmetrical, for about $160CAD / month, including 5 static IP addresses. That's pretty fast, and we intend to host some things locally.

A few doors down, [[Brewster Kahle]] and [[The Permanent Library]] of [[Internet Archive Canada]] have a 10Gbps connection that we could connect directly to.

[[221A]] have their [[Node Library]] project and a mini-server room in their new building on Pacific and could connect.

I have connections at TELUS that might be supportive of this work.

* What can we do with 10Gbps or 100Gbps connections? What equipment  is capable of such speeds?
* Expand CANARIE (or a new, bottoms up network) outside of "just" academic institutions -- startups, non-profits, creative spaces
* Run software as a commons for specific purposes -- p2p except over a managed

### Toronto

[[Hypha Co-op]] have a rack at Front Street

[[1RG]] might be a physical space to run some things.

[[535 Toronto]] could get looped in.

### Calgary

[[831 House]] in Calgary.
