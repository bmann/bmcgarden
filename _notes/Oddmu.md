From the [README](https://github.com/kensanata/oddmu):

> This program helps you run a minimal wiki. There is no version history. It's well suited as a _secondary_ medium: collaboration and conversation happens elsewhere, in chat, on social media. The wiki serves as the text repository that results from these discussions.
> 
If you're the only user and it just runs on your laptop, then you can think of it as a [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), a memory extender.
