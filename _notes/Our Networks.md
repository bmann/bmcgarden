## 2024

Our Networks is a community event about the past, present, and future of
building network infrastructures. The event hosts keynotes, talks, and
hands-on sessions on topics including: decentralized systems,
peer-to-peer web, community networks, and new network communication and
storage protocols. We have hosted five previous events since 2017.

Drawing on practices of local-first, solar-powered servers, folk
software, and permacomputing, Our Networks 2024 explores what
collaboration looks like when a network is optional. Looking at
transitional technologies and forms of computing that break from
always-on connectivity as we spend a day connecting over local networks.
