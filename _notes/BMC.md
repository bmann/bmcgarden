BMC is short for B. Mann Consulting aka this root domain and related subdomains that are my websites. It's also my short hand for things related to tinkering with this site.

Yes, I registered it in late 2000 and could have picked a way more interesting web address. I'll pick a better one next time.

## To Do

<style>
	li {
		list-style-type: none;
	}
	.task-list-item-checkbox {
		margin-right: 5px;
	}
</style>

- [ ] Journal feed: consider linking back to the actual journal entry. ~~Hmm, or maybe appending a hashtag like `BMCJournal` for context~~
- [ ] Journal feed: do tags-as-hashtags and append them
- [ ] Journal feed: do something special if link exists and append it[^feedaffordances]
- [x] Journal feed: Figure out how to make sure that full path image links are included
- [x] Update front page to have recent journal entries. 
- [x] Display “via” frontmatter [[via]]
- [x] Turn off linking out to notes
- [x] Tags? Something like “if tag same as Note, then link” or “on Note, list all pages with same tag”. Even with a “blank” [[Wiki]] page, you get all the notes tagged with wiki displaying. 
- [ ] Test run of re-importing LogSeq
- [ ] Make a [[Colophon]] feed by looking at Journal entries tagged with `colophon`
- [x] Add a style for `<li>` that have Obsidian `task-list-marker` class
- [x] Change date formatting for journal pages to include / highlight time posted rather than just day
- [ ] Reconsider slugs for journal. Maybe: `YYYY/MMDD/HHmm`.
- [ ] Main journal page will grow forever. Have to figure out daily or monthly pages. Pagination?
- [x] Add blog posts to home page 
- [x] Reverse chron sort for journal pages? Or at least home page journal listing?

[^feedaffordances]: Context for this should be “how is this useful to a Mastodon / Bluesky / etc reader?” - tags help in discovery, link to main article is most useful for reading
