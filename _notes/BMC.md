BMC is short for B. Mann Consulting aka this root domain and related subdomains that are my websites. It's also my short hand for things related to tinkering with this site.

Yes, I registered it in late 2000 and could have picked a way more interesting web address. I'll pick a better one next time.

## To Do

- [ ] Journal feed modification to truncate and include link back to journal post. Will Microblog respect 500 characters?
	- Maybe not? I think things are coming through OK
	- I should consider linking back to the actual journal entry. Hmm, or maybe appending a hashtag like `BMCJournal` for context
	- could also do tags-as-hashtags and append them
	- Maybe: do something special if link exists
- [ ] Update front page to have recent journal entries. 
- [x] Display “via” frontmatter [[via]]
- [x] Turn off linking out to notes
- [x] Tags? Something like “if tag same as Note, then link” or “on Note, list all pages with same tag”. Even with a “blank” [[Wiki]] page, you get all the notes tagged with wiki displaying. 
- [ ] Test run of re-importing LogSeq
- [ ] Make a [[Colophon]] feed by looking at Journal entries tagged with `colophon`
- [ ] Add a style for `<li>` that have Obsidian `task-list-marker` class
