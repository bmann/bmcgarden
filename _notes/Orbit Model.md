> * Love is a member's level of engagement and activity in the community.
> * Reach is a measure of a community memberâ€™s sphere of influence.
> * Gravity is the attractive force of a community that acts to retain existing members and attract new ones.
> * Orbit levels are a practical tool for member segmentation and used to design different programs for each level of the community.
> 
> The goal of the Orbit Model is to increase the Gravity of your community.
