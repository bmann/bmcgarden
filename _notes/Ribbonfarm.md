- Hi, I am Venkatesh Rao, and Ribbonfarm is a blog I’ve been writing since 2007. [Many other writers](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/contributors/) have contributed to this blog over the years.
- The name Ribbonfarm refers to the [ribbon farms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_farm) of 18th century Detroit — strips of lands 2-3 miles long, each with 2-300 yards along the Detroit river waterfront — that the then French governor used to resolve water disputes. We think it is a great metaphor for a blog trying to get a thin slice of attention from the great river of eyeballs that is the Web.
