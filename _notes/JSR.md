> The open-source package registry for modern JavaScript and TypeScript

Focused on native TypeScript support for many different runtimes. 
## Why JSR?

> Made for **TypeScript & ESM**
> 
> JSR is designed for TypeScript. You publish TypeScript source, and JSR handles generating API docs, `.d.ts`files, and transpiling your code for cross-runtime compatibility.
> 
> JSR packages are distributed as web-standard ECMAScript modules.

## Works with any runtime

> JSR modules can be used in Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and more.
