	- I made 9 Investments in 16 months at [[Full Stack]] in 2013 / 2014 of $1.75M. After 5 years in 2019 we drew a line and summed things up. Roughly 3x return at that time, with a number of companies still in play.
	  It was a unique structure that did really well for investors and barely paid for my personal time ;) I think the model could scale - more pre-seed in quantity. Not government BS “scale up” services.
	- European and US angels and some pre-seed specialized funds in those places are writing pre-seed cheques. It used to be much worse in continental Europe than in Canada. We are behind and falling.
	- The only improvement is that Europe/US investors mostly don’t blink an eye at Canadian corps — so we still get that benefit.
	- But with a worse banking and services market than the US or Europe, being a Canadian company can hamper you in many ways. Yes, SRED/IRAP … which isn’t really worth it until you’re raising a large seed or Series A **and** for distributed / remote hiring is nullified. It’s easier / cheaper to find great staff globally, and I mean just numbers of people … not underpaying internationally.
	- So: continuing to cheer you on at Eigenspace. Perhaps an Eigenspace West? (I’m not volunteering!)
