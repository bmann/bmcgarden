Running something in single user mode for self hosting means that you are expending a lot of effort for just yourself.

Maybe this is rugged individualism, but instead, what if you pooled effort for a group of people?

That both means resiliency where you yourself aren't a single point of failure -- from both a personal level as well as a hardware and software perspective! -- and serving and supporting a set of people with a mix of skills and resources.
