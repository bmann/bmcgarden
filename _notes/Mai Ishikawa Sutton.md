From their web page:

> My work lies at the intersection of technology and the solidarity economy. I’m passionate about strengthening the digital commons, in which people control and steward communication technologies as collective goods.

> I’m interested in how digital commoning is made possible through cooperative ownership, decentralized technologies, and governance structures that allow strong patterns of communication and constructive feedback loops.
