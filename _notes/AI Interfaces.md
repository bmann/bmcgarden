## Deconstructed Media

> In order to be able to do faithful transformations across modalities, we need software that has an understanding of the media. Not just the pixel values or words used, but an understanding of what the objects, ideas and composition is. We need world models.

## Creative Control

> One of the big gripes with AI tooling is that for most of it - we go from some high-level idea like “I want a picture of an old man with a cane” to a fully finished piece of media...This takes away all the autonomy from those doing the creative work and feels incredibly reductive.
> 
> ...what we really need is tools that allow us to think about media at a higher level, to fill in the gaps and simplify tasks, without reducing our ability to express ourselves and get our hands dirty.
> 
> We need tools that give us intuitive sense of what it will output & the ability to steer it. Text will only get us so far.
