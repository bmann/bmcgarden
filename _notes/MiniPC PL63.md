## Unbox and Setup

Why is this box so big??? Oh, it comes with a keyboard and mouse. 

This thing is tiny! Smaller and lighter than the [[Lenovo M900 Tiny]].

This is the Thunderbolt 4 model. I plugged it into my [[VisionTek VT2900]] and it worked right away.

First time on Windows 11. I sure am declining a lot of things. Lots of updates and rebooting.
