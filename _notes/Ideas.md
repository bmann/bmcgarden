I have many ideas for [[Proto Apps]]
### Gaming

A gaming social network that bootstraps by using your SteamID to OAuth link to a new account. Might also be able to cross-post various things.

Nouns:
* Game
* Purchase
* Achievements
* Review
* Image: screenshots as well as fan art and any other such image
* Video: could also include live streams
### Code

Github is the social platform that has captured the world's code. What does it look like to start building a proto-app that focuses on social activity around code that works across platforms?

Some things that could integrate:
* [[Radicle]]
* [[Git Butler]]
* [[Polar]]

[[ForgeFed]] is the ActivityPub version of this.

Nouns:
* Repo
* Issue
* Release
