title: Worklog

Daily and/or weekly notes, often quite detailed, of what you're doing. 

This can be part of a [[Second Brain]], or just a basic log to keep you on track.

Especially for people that are doing a lot of tasks, often many of them small and with context switching, it can be hard to get to the end of a day and feel like you really haven't accomplished anything.

I'm experimenting with a [[Yearlog]] since I've got 20 years of content to play with :)
