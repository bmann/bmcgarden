I'm using the Marfa theme from [[Micro.blog]] for my site [blog.bmannconsulting.com](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com). My fork is public here: https://github.com/bmann/theme-marfa

## To Do

Also from internet-weblog, look at the [yearly grouping](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/yearly_grouping.html) for the archive page. Live example on the authors blog: https://jnjosh.com/posts/. Archive as is right now, with giant list of Categories and then boring post list, is definitely bad.

Post pages have avatar and microblog at the bottom. Change this to ???

Home page has avatar and "follow on Mb" links. Change to ???

No pagination on Photos page. Remove and replace with a new / different photos layout.

Error on bio page (linked to avatar). Need to include new partial.

Custom 404 page, need to add `not_found.html`

## Done

The "Call to Action" (CTA) on single posts in the upper right hand corner points to Mb -- point it at bmannconsulting for now.

Footer link to Mb, point it at bmannconsulting for now.

Moved custom footer partial inside the **actual** footer, rather than just blank text at the end of the page.

Looking at [internet-weblog theme](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog) for ideas, adding categories to posts.
