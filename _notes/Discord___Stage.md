- From the FAQ:
	- > Stage channels are a special type of voice channel you can create in your Community server. They are for conversations and events where some people can talk and others can listen as the audience.
	  > 
	  > If you’re running an event where you want only a select number of participants to be speaking or on video at a time with a majority of the audience in passive, listening mode - then Stage channels offer a great way to support and run that event!
	  > 
	  > In testing, we’ve seen people use Stage channels to run AMAs, Fireside Chats, Townhalls, Reading Groups, and more!
