title: Web Feeds
---

@MattWebb built [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com) to explain web feeds. [Introducing About Feeds](http://interconnected.org/home/2020/08/12/introducing_aboutfeeds) is his intro article.

> aboutfeeds.com is a single page website, for linking wherever you keep your web feed.

> If you go to the homepage of this very blog you’ll see a header on the left that says “GET LATEST POSTS”. Next to that is a link that says “FEED.” As we all know, that link is broken unless you have a newsreader app installed. And so next it is a new link that says: HELP! WHAT IS A FEED?

I added a [[Feeds]] page. Right now, just RSS. Why not just call it RSS? Well, there's Atom, there are [[JSON Feeds]], and [[ActivityPub]] / [[ActivityStreams]] are all under the bigger umbrella of Web Feeds.
