> building citizen networks rather than social networks

We are building **Agora**, an open-source platform aimed at enhancing _civic participation_ and combatting _censorship_ and _computational propaganda_ in a privacy-preserving way.

Computational propaganda refers to the "use of algorithms, automation, and human curation to purposefully distribute misleading information over social media networks" (Woolley & Howard, 2018). It exacerbates societal divisions, creates confusions, and manipulates electoral outcomes, thus undermining democracies.

## Core Technical Innovation

> based on [[Verifiable Credentials]] and Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs, that allows users to have granular control over their identities and data on social media. This solution not only is resistant to bots or fake accounts but also maximizes user privacy.
