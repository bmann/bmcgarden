Running software on your own servers.

Some open source software whose primary business is a SaaS / cloud offering will also have a self-hosting option.

Some strict definitions of this might be that you have to have your own server, perhaps in a [[Home Lab]]. But most often this also applies to running / maintaining software on your own, even if that's in a Digital Ocean Droplet or other cloud virtual machine.
