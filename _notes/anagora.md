An [[Agora]] implementation by @Flancian.

The concept is to have nodes / notes where people maintain their own digital notes garden like I do here, but then pull them in and link them through their public git repos. Aka a "distributed knowledge graph".

The [[Agora Plan]][^agoraplan] page has more details. It is written in [[Python]] / Flask and is open source under the [[Apache2 License]].

[^agoraplan]: Not sure what the syntax should be here. I want to link to the "global" [Agora plan](https://anagora.org/node/agora-plan) page.

This site is [[Connecting to the Agora]] as of January 24th, 2021

## Feature Requests

Ideas about the agora social system as a whole, but for now mostly technical features of the Agora server software and the main [[Anagora]] instance. Join us on the [[FedStoa]] [[GitLab]] to add your own ideas <https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/agora-server>

* Ideas on `agora.yml` format, mainly [[Jekyll]] inspired <https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/agora-server/-/issues/1>
* If no local node found for [[wikilinks]], then auto-link to global node?
