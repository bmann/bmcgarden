An [[Agora]] implementation by @Flancian.

The concept is to have nodes / notes where people maintain their own digital notes garden like I do here, but then pull them in and link them through their public git repos. Aka a "distributed knowledge graph".

The [Agora Plan](https://anagora.org/node/agora-plan) page has more details, including a link to the [[Agora Server::https://github.com/flancian/agora-server]]. It is written in [[Python]] / Flask and is open source under the [[Apache2 License]].
