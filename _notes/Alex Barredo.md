- My name is Álex Barredo. I am a programmer turned analyst, turned podcaster. Currently researching about “onlineness”: why people do what they do & say what they say online.
- I write a [daily newsletter](https://newsletter.mixx.io/) about technology with [a podcast to match](https://podcast.mixx.io/). Both are pretty neat.
- I’m the tech lead at [Cuonda.com](https://cuonda.com/), a lovely full-fledged podcasting platform.
- I work with talent and advertising agencies at [VoiceUp.es](https://voiceup.es/) managing sponsorships and marketing campaigns.
