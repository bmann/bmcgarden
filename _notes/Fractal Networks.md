- Self hosting network
- Mosaic Docs https://docs.fractalnetworks.co
	- Mosaic is a **noncustodial**, **free** and **open source personal computing platform** designed to make self-hosting accessible and survivable.
	- It works by running applications using industry-standard **Docker containers**, with a WireGuard based **end-to-end encrypted** connectivity solution that gives you a unique domain (such as `hasty-hopper.fractal.pub`) to make sure your applications are always reachable, and an **end-to-end encrypted** storage solution that continuously creates snapshots and backups of your data, allowing your applications to be restored automatically at any time and without hassle. This makes Fractal Mosaic the only **ephemeral self-hosting solution**: you can, at any time, wipe your hard drive and re-install Fractal Mosaic and all of your applications and data will be restored back, exactly as they were.
