Started at RBC Ventures, and then [acquired Founded in 2020](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/ownr-by-rbc-ventures-acquires-leading-legal-tech-platform-founded-865651145.html). The Founded service was much better, so it was just rebranded as Ownr.

It's tightly coupled to RBC banking services.
