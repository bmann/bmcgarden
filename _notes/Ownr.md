Online business incorporation tool for Canada.

Started at RBC Ventures, and then [acquired Founded in 2020](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/ownr-by-rbc-ventures-acquires-leading-legal-tech-platform-founded-865651145.html). The Founded service was much better, so it was just rebranded as Ownr.

It's tightly coupled to RBC banking services.

For small businesses or sole proprietor, it can be OK. For startups that plan on taking investment, the documents and structured often have to be re-done by a knowledgeable Canadian startup lawyer.

## Sole Proprietorship

Does a name search and then prompts you to sign up for an RBC account and optional RBC credit card.

## Perks

Discounts and free months of a handful of services. Here are some selected ones that seem useful:
* 3 free months of 1Password Business or Family
* $5000 in AWS Credits
