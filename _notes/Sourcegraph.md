Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform that allows developers to rapidly search, write, and understand code by bringing insights from their entire codebase right into their editor. We help developers and companies with billions of lines of code create the software you use every day.

An [[All Remote]] company, which means:

>- We work [asynchronously](https://www.notion.so/communication/asynchronous-communication.md) across time zones and continents.
    - You choose when you want to work. (Most people work the normal working hours for their time zone.)
    - You don't need to ask permission or tell anyone if you need to step out.
    - We try to limit the number of synchronous meetings, but there are some company and team meetings that you need to attend which might be outside of your normal working hours. We do our best to optimize meeting times for all involved participants.
> - All teammates are encouraged to work remotely. Sourcegraph provides a budget for home offices or office spaces to teammates as needed.
> - We use our business office address in San Francisco to provide a mailing address, for corporate filings, and on-site workplaces as legally required.
