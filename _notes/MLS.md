Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is an [IETF working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) building a modern, efficient, secure group messaging protocol.

From the FAQ: _Should I use this right now?_

> Yes! The protocol has been approved by the IESG and has been published as RFC9420. There are severalÂ [implementations](https://github.com/mlswg/mls-implementations), of which some are open source.
