A social file exchange. For designers, artists, DJs, writers, musicians,  
researchers, engineers.

> USB Club is a digital-physical society of cratediggers and filesharers. Our members are artists, DJs, technologists, and everything else. Your USB is your membership, so keep it somewhere safe: keychain, necklace, etc.  
>
> Every day, you’ll share a file with the Club and receive files from other members you subscribe to. Most of our members subscribe to everyone else. Hit Discover → Subscribe to All to do that.  
>   
> The day’s files disappear at midnight If you shared a file that day, you’ll see them the next time you plug in. One file – your Pro-File – lives next to your bio and does not disappear.  
>   
> Now, what will you share with the club?

The system requires you to have a USB key, as well as a desktop "Console" app installed.
