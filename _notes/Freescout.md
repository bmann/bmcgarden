Open source shared Helpdesk and Shared Mailbox

Available for self hosting on [[Cloudron]]

Itâ€™s free of charge to self host, but has a number of [one-time-purchase modules](https://freescout.net/modules/) that you can pay for. These are AGPL licensed, so all still open source. [Modules FAQ](https://freescout.net/modules-faq/)
