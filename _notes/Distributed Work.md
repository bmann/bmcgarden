I’ll generally use the phrase “distributed work” rather than “remote work” as remote was originally defined as in-office work where some people were remote. 

Distributed work better captures what I mean and my ideal of people working in a distributed way: whether you go into an office or work from home or a coworking space, what work patterns and communication patterns do you use so that anyone can participate, find information, and collaborate?
