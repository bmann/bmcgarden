Causal Islands LA is the first community edition of the 2023 conference held in [[Causal Islands#Toronto, April 2023|Toronto]].

​Causal Islands at a high level is about the [[future of computing]]. And it's about connecting people across different specializations and disciplines to come together – to get off their islands and share deep info to inspire and connect with others.
## ​Presentations & Discussions

​We're going to have a mix of presentations plus Q&A, and group discussions.

​Some of the themes include creative usage of technology, how we manage and collaborate, DWeb, decentralized compute, tools for thought, open source — including governance and maintaining it, local first software, open social protocols, art and computation, and more.

​We have several great presentations that we'll be sharing soon. If you'd like to give a talk or host a discussion, please submit to the [call for presentations](https://schedule.fission.codes/causal-islands-losangeles-2024/cfp).
