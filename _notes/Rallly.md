> Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool designed to make organizing events and meetings easier.

I don't know what this class of apps is called. A poll for finding shared meeting times. Poll creators need to have accounts, but time-pickers don't necessarily have to.

Github: <https://github.com/lukevella/rallly>

README:

> Schedule group meetings with friends, colleagues and teams. Create meeting polls to find the best date and time to organize an event based on your participants' availability. Save time and avoid back-and-forth emails.
> 
> Built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/), [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) & [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

> Check out the [self-hosting docs](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting) for more information on running your own instance of Rallly.

## Licensing

[[AGPL]] licensed.

The suggestion if you find the self-hosted version useful, is a [social expectation to pay a one-time $42USD fee](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting/pricing).

> Rallly is **completely free** to self-host. But free software doesn’t mean it’s without cost. Someone has to develop, maintain, and support it. If you find Rallly useful you can help support further development by paying a one-time fee.
> 
> **Suggested Price**
> 
> We believe $42 USD is a very fair price for the time and effort that’s gone into making this product. It’s also the cost of a yearly subscription to the [official managed service](https://rallly.co/). If you find Rallly useful and can afford to pay, please consider paying this amount.

Or, pay-what-you-want.
