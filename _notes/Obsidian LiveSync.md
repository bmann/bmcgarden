Recommended to me by [@amie.pw on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/amie.pw/post/3l3sljacj7y2m)

I used the [CouchDB template](https://railway.app/template/eRC98l) on [[Railway]]. And then I had to do a bunch of reading on what environment variables to set.

The first is `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` for the admin.

It's not really working, too much yak shaving.
