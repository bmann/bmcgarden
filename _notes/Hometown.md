A supported fork of [[Mastodon]] that provides local posting and a wider range of content types.

Created and maintained by [[Darius Kazemi]]

**Hometown** is a light weight fork of Mastodon. By "light weight" I don't mean more efficient; I mean this fork is 99.999% identical to Mastodon with a few key tweaks. This project is based on the principle of: minimum code change for maximum user experience change. This makes it easy for the basically-one-person who runs the project to keep it up to date. By our best understanding, our major changes are not wanted by the Mastodon project, hence maintaining this fork instead of trying to commit the changes to Mastodon.

Please [check out our wiki](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) for a list of Hometown-exclusive features. Some but not all of these are covered in this document.
