- About
	- The Librecast Live project contributes to decentralizing the Internet by enabling multicast. Multicast is an important network capability for a secure, decentralized and private by defaultÂ [[Next Generation Internet]]
	- The original design goals of the Internet do not match today's privacy and security needs, and this is evident in the technologies in use today. There are some situations where multicast can already be deployed on the Internet. This project is building the transitional protocols and software required to extend the reach of multicast and enable easy deployment by software developers.
- A transitional technology while we wait for [[IPv6]]
	- Librecast will allow disconnected multicast networks to communicate, enabling multicast applications to have the same reach and reliability as their unicast counterparts, thus making multicast communication a viable option for software developers.
