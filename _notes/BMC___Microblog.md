- I run [blog.bmannconsulting.com](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com) on [[Micro.blog]]
- Microblog length posts, less tech and more personal
- Cross-posted to Twitter and Mastodon
- The [[Blog Colophon]] has the history of bloggy content
- LATER Consider whether `bmann.ca` could be the personal domain
	- Frankly, using your microblog at a blog subdomain is confusing ðŸ¤ª
