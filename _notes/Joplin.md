- Open source, markdown-based note taking & to do. Originally designed to import Evernote `.enex` files.
- Available on many platforms, including mobile apps and even terminal. Uses different cloud services for synchronization, but encrypted with your own keys, eg [[Dropbox]].
- I don't use it any more. I'm using [[Roam Research]] for private notes and its mobile web interface works fine for quick note taking.
