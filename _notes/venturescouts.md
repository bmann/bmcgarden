_Growing the next generation of founders and funders in [[Canada]]_

One of my current [[Projects]]. There is a [[Discourse]] forum at https://venturescouts.ca which anyone can join.

There are a variety of members-only groups on the site as well, including Pitch Deck Review.

## To Do

* [[TODO]] Kick off peer mentoring: get members to post a peer profile with the topics that they're interested in providing peer mentorship on, as well as how to get in touch / book some time (e.g. [[Calendly]] link)
* [[TODO]] We're discussing what a venture scout fund would look like in Canada
