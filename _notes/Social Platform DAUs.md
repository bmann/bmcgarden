Since I put together [[Open Social DAUs]], it's useful to compare this with current social platforms.

In contrast to [[Open Social Protocols]], I'll define Social Platforms as those that are proprietary systems run by one company. These systems all "compete" with each other, in the sense that people can only spend so much time looking at so many different apps and networks.

For Open Social Protocols, I tend to _exclude_ chat only systems. Posts are available on the web, publicly linkable / browse-able, and the core activity is in public. This means they can be widely shared, embedded, covered in the media, and so on. The original definition of "social" media. At the same time, just "microblogging that mostly is a Twitter clone" is less helpful -- Instagram has a gigantic user base, and fits a lot of this criteria, and definitely isn't microblogging.

Also: per-country / region information is highly relevant, including platforms that see wide usage in primarily one country.

So my disclaimers are, these are the stats that I felt like finding out and including :)

## Twitter

## Instagram

## Threads
