- An unconference is a participant-driven meeting without pre-planned sessions
- > Sarah Winge, the organizer (with [[Tim O'Reilly]] of [[Foo Camp]], an early unconference, drew on her experience of open space and conversations with Harrison Owen to develop the format. The first Foo Camp happened October 10–12, 2003, in Sebastopol, California. In 2005 some of the attendees from previous years decided to produce their own [[BarCamp]]. These three events, BloggerCon, Foo Camp and BarCamp helped to popularize the term "unconference". https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference
- Techniques from [[Open Space Technology]] are used, where unconferences originated

- I’ve run and founded many unconference style events, including [[BarCamp]], #[[Northern Voice]] [[MooseCamp]], [[Polyglot Conference]], and [[Ethereum Magicians]]
	- The format usually starts with gathering all together and then having people suggest talks and topics
	- Participants can then “vote” on which topics are of interest
	- Facilitators then schedule and organize topics across spaces and time
	- The sessions themselves can be run in a number of ways
