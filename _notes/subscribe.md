Notes are the main wiki pages that I create here.

The [Notes](/notes/) page currently shows items sorted by a modified date, but I changed the feed to show them by creation date, as modified by proved to be unreliable.

**Links** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/links.xml"><img src="https://bmannconsulting.com/assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

Anything with a link field. Mostly comes in two flavours. One is a kind of bookmark, that links to an app, or open source tool, or a website that I want to keep track of and perhaps write a few things about. The second is an Article, where I take notes and quote pieces of it that I find interesting. The [Links](/links/) page shows both kinds.

**Blog** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/blog.xml"><img src="https://bmannconsulting.com/assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

The home page and the [Blog](/blog/) page list recent blogs.

More frequent personal posts and social content like photos is on my [Micro.blog](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com). The latest post from that also appears embedded on the home page.

**Journal** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/journal.xml"><img src="https://bmannconsulting.com/assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

These are short Notes and Bookmarks, which you can view on the [Journal](/journal/) page. They are more like notes-to-self.
