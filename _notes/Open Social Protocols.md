The three protocols that I think are going to continue to grow and be adopted are:

* [[ActivityPub]]: Meta building Threads with ActivityPub support, and AP's status as a [[W3C]] standard will keep it around.
* [[ATProtocol]]: most scalable architecture.
* [[Farcaster]]: crypto-adjacent while also being primarily off chain data. Will be the basis for many crypto-centric social experiences. Innovation of creating [[Farcaster Frames]].

I'm interested in seeing [[Open Frames]] work across all of these protocols and beyond.

I'm tracking [[Open Social DAUs]] to see what adoption looks like.
