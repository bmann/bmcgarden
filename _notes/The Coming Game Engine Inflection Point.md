- > Barely a month after the major restructuring, Riccitiello [announced plans](https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2022/Unity-Announces-Merger-Agreement-with-ironSource/default.aspx) for Unity to merge with [ironSource](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525632-unity-and-ironsource-what-are-investors-missing), an ‘app monetisation’ platform. This merger would narrow the game engine’s focus to use cases that prioritise micro-transactions, data collection and paywalls.

In 2022, its future is uncertain and focused on a pivot headed by a corporate leader who had demonstrably failed in similar roles with similar strategies. More worryingly, in an era of unprecedented US [domestic](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/06/24/text-supreme-court-ruling-overturning-roe-v-wade/) and [international](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pelosi-expected-arrive-taiwan-tuesday-sources-say-2022-08-02/) belligerence, this repositioning by company whose products are installed on millions of devices – from smartphones to medical training programmes to electric cars to [military use](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/unity-is-now-helping-design-simulation-programs-for-the-us-military/ar-AA10zgee) – is a direct move into data-brokerage and surveillance. Organisations and companies outside of the United States hoping to incorporate game engines into their work must evaluate this new development as a major threat to a project’s digital integrity.
- Interesting read continues, with thoughts on [[Epic Games]] being owned by China-controlled [[Tencent]], and the US-China relations around this.  Plus Epic being out of the [[Apple app store]]
- Final section is cheerleading for open source [[Godot Engine]] as a potential third path
