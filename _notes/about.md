## Availability

I support founders and the Canadian startup funding ecosystem through [[Venture Scouts]], and you can browse current and past [[Projects]].

As of [[June 2019]], I'm full time committed to [[Fission]] https://fission.codes, where I am co-founder and CEO.

## Background

I am a technologist who has progressively moved more into business, product, and marketing, as well as leveling up in investment and venture capital.

I've never been paid to code, but tinker with new technologies as part of relying on my technical background to help build bridges and explain technology through the lens of business and product.

As part of my move back to Vancouver in 2004, I became part of the growth of Vancouver's web & entrepreneur community. I took part in the beginnings of Web 2.0, including open source, blogging, and the emergence of social media. Including being [member #1746 on LinkedIn](https://microblog.bmannconsulting.com/2020/08/12/linkedin.html).

I strive to align my personal interests – working with smart people on great projects that involve people-centric technology – with what I do for work. My work-life balance tends to come from making sure that I am involved in mission-driven companies that I can get behind and champion.

Aside from my interest in technology, I live in Vancouver & I like food. You can find posts on these topics on [my microblog »](https://microblog.bmannconsulting.com)
