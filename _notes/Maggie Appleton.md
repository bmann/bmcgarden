Designer, anthropologist, and mediocre developer.

> I sit at the intersection of design, anthropology, and programming. These three are at the core of everything I make. Combining them into a coherent career is a weird and ongoing challenge.
> 
> Titles and disciplines are fickle and fleeting. But my work fits under the umbrellas of UX design, visual interface design, and DX (developer experience). With some cultural analysis, writing, and visual illustration sprinkled on top.
>
> I currently lead design at [Elicit](https://elicit.com/) where we're exploring how machine learning can help researchers with open-ended reasoning.
