When I say professional desktop operating system, I mean Windows and MacOS on laptops and desktop computers.[^linux] 

[^linux]: And yes, the graphical Linux desktop experience as well. The low level Linux OS lives on in many appliance, mobile, and embedded devices. This also means it will never be the Year of Linux on the Desktop, because the desktop is going away.

The vast majority of people on the planet use mobile devices as their one and only computing device. 

I don’t have good stats on desktop computer sales. But we clearly see as a ratio of time spent on desktop vs non desktop operating systems, humanity’s time is spent not on the desktop. 

I do think there’s room for new metaphors. [[spatial computing]] is one direction, and looking at the cost of the [[Apple Vision Pro]], it will remain professional… until it too becomes ubiquitous on mobile.
