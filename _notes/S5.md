A “decentralized network that puts you in control of your data and identity”.

> “…a content-addressed storage network similar to IPFS, but with some new concepts and ideas to make it more efficient and powerful.”

Written in Dart and Rust. 

Supports a variety of storage backends, including S3.

Uses [[BLAKE3]].

## Peer-to-peer

> S5 uses a peer-to-peer network to find providers who serve a specific file. Compared to IPFS, S5 does NOT transfer or exchange file data between peers directly. Instead, the p2p network is only meant to find storage locations and download links for a specific file hash.
