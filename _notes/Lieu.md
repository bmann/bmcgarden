> [Lieu](https://github.com/cblgh/lieu) is a community search engine, a way for personal [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) to surface their contents and invite visitors to browse them. It’s a tool for crawling a limited set of links, noting down their contents, and a service making the corpus of pages searchable in a [simple website](https://lieu.cblgh.org/).

Github [README](https://github.com/cblgh/lieu)

> Created in response to the environs of apathy concerning the use of hypertext search and discovery. In Lieu, the internet is not what is made searchable, but instead one's own neighbourhood. Put differently, Lieu is a neighbourhood search engine, a way for personal webrings to increase serendipitous connexions.

Built by [[Alex Cobleigh]] for the [[Merveilles]] community.
