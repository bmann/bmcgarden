> New_ Public strives to ensure that every community has a healthy digital public space


> We believe in reimagining the internet as a public space
> 
> We want spaces on the internet that foster connection, facilitate pluralism, and encourage civic engagement.

> We have two main strategies to achieve this: helping [local communities across America](https://newpublic.org/local-connection) create more flourishing digital spaces and developing prototypes for digital conversation with [public service media organizations](https://newpublic.org/psi).

## Public Spaces Incubator

Public Service Media (PSM) organizations 

> The Public Spaces Incubator brings together **CBC/Radio-Canada** (Canada), **RTBF**(Belgium), **SRG SSR** (Switzerland), **ZDF**(Germany), and **New_ Public** (United States) to re-conceptualize how to use PSM platforms for public connection and conversation.
