An open specification for 

From the [specification repo](https://github.com/open-frames/standard):

> Since the launch of [[Farcaster Frames]], we’ve seen a number of protocols work to add Frames support independently. The original Frames spec was designed for Farcaster and wasn’t set up to handle interactions from different types of applications with unique capabilities. Open Frames is a lightweight extension to the Frames spec to help coordinate the many new applications and protocols adopting Frames.
> 
> Open Frames is an initiative with the following goals:
> 
> 1. Allow Frames developers to support interactions from different types of clients
> 2. Don’t screw up the best thing about Frames: how easy it is to build on
> 
> We expect the Open Frames specification to evolve, both through improvements to the Farcaster Specification and through the needs of Open Frames applications with different capabilities.

## About

Frames are an interactive social object based around adding specific [[OpenGraph]] tags to any web page which are then rendered as an interactive "frame" made of images, text input, and some action buttons that are rendered in the host client application.

The input of a Frame is nothing more than a link, e.g. `example.com/some/frame/path`, which makes them a little bit like an [[unfurl]] or [[OEmbed]] that a number of applications already support.
