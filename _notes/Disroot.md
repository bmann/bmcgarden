- From the [about page](https://disroot.org/en/about):
	- **Disroot** is a project that was born from the personal need to communicate, share and organize ourselves within our circles through tools that met a series of fundamental criteria for us: they had to be **open**, **decentralized**, **federated** and above all **respectful** towards **freedom** and **privacy**. None of the most popular solutions complied with them, but in our search we found some very interesting projects that did. And since we thought that they should be available to all those with similar ethical principles, we decided not only to group these applications and share them with others, but also to manage them according to those values. That's how **Disroot** started.
