title: Vancouver Local Makers Directory
---

There isn't a directory of local artists and other makers in [[Vancouver]].

Ideally, this would have a number of goals:

* list local makers
* increase sales to those makers
* connect local supply chains

## What goods are made in Vancouver?

This is sort of the main question, perhaps connected to "Can I buy X in Vancouver?".

## Shopify Site, Monthly Specials

An idea is to build a Shopify site that lists makers.

Users can browse makers and go directly to their site. Can also subscribe to a mailing list with monthly specials.

Every month, makers submit a limited availability special -- either limited in price or actual special edition. This gets sent to the mailing list with a 24 hour head start, then shared publicly.

Ideally this is done in such a way that orders are fulfilled directly by makers.

Get makers to just set up special on their own site? If so, wouldn't need Shopify.

### Is Shopify the right thing to make / maintain such a list?

Need to research plugins for letting people update / submit their own entries.
