I like to tell people about my [[Three Definitions of Open Source]] as context. 

Iâ€™m interested in [[Commons Funding]] and [[Open Source Licensing]], but most especially [[Commons Based Peer Production]]: how to work together to produce and maintain things. Open source code and related open data goods are very common, but peer production and [[co-op]] structures can and should be applied to many more things.
