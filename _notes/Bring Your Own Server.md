This is a term I'm exploring around software that installs on your own server, that then fully manages it and offers other capabilities around it.

[[Cloudron]] and [[Coolify]] are two examples of this.

Another trend I'm seeing in more commercial cloud platforms is that the high end / enterprise option includes the options to plug in your own AWS or other cloud credentials. The service becomes a sort of managed PaaS, where you pay for the management and support, but separately pay AWS or other cloud provider for the data, compute, and other commodity resources used.

[[Fission]]'s [Everywhere Computer](https://everywhere.computer) is also designed with the ability to always bring your own server.
