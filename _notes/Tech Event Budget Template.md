I've run 100s of events from meetups to large conferences over the years. This is a simple tech budget that you can use as a template to estimate costs, sponsors, and so on.

This is a base model for a 100 person conference that assumes:
* volunteer organizers
* not paying speakers
* no paid design or website work

There are many other items that are necessary for running larger events. It should also be easily editable for smaller and simpler meetups.

I've plugged in a line item for A/V that is relatively high. Getting high quality recordings of talks are a great resource, something that sponsors can sponsor / have their logos and materials embedded in, and is valuable for speakers and future versions of the event.
