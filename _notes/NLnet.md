> We support organisations and people who contribute to an open internet for all. We fund projects that help fix the internet through open hardware, open software, open standards, open science and open data. After its [historical contribution to the early internet in Europe](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/history) in the 1980's, NLnet has been financially supporting the open internet since 1997.

## Projects we support

> NLnet has contributed funding to many important and very visible projects around fundamental standards from securing the **core routing protocols** and the **domain name system** of the internet to **safer email**, **vendor-independent videoconferencing**, **more reliable wireless networks** and **private instant messaging** - all based on open standards and verifiable open source software and/or hardware. It spawned the world-renowned [NLnet Labs](http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/), and supported great open source projects like [Jitsi](https://nlnet.nl/project/jitsi), [Peertube](https://nlnet.nl/project/PeerTube), [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com/), [NoScript](https://nlnet.nl/project/noscriptmob2), [Tor Hidden Services](https://nlnet.nl/project/tor-hidden), [GPLv3](https://nlnet.nl/project/gpl3), [GNUnet](https://nlnet.nl/project/gnunet), and [CryptPad](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPad-Blueprints).
