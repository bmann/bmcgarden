"A note-taking tool for networked thought. As easy to use as a document. As powerful as a graph database. Roam helps you organize your research for the long haul."

I currently use Roam for my private note taking. I practice making a daily [[Worklog]], taking notes on meetings, running a lightweight CRM, and managing my personal TODOs with it.
