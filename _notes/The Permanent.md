- > Erected a century ago, the venue is named after the BC Permanent & Loan Company, which first opened itsâ€™ doors in 1907. In 1935, the Bank of Canada called this place home, leaving it's mark for decades to come. Recently, The Permanent was completely restored, bringing a landmark, heritage space back to the community. http://www.thepermanent.ca/the-space
