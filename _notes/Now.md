You may have heard that I'm [winding down](https://fission.codes/blog/farewell-from-fission/) [[Fission]] as of April 2024.

I'm talking to lots of people, exploring a few different things.
*  I applied to [Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com) (didn't get accepted!) with some ideas around [[Community Search Engines]]. Still exploring other opportunities for this.
* ~~I'm also going to apply to be a Mozilla Fellow~~ (didn't end up applying), with some ideas around [[Local AI]]
* Interested in [[Proto Apps]]
* Want to do some work on [[Open Frames]] -- bringing [[Farcaster Frames]] to [[ActivityPub]] and [[Bluesky]].

Going to see about [[Causal Islands]] regional events. First up, [[Causal Islands Berlin]].

I'm in a new co-working space in Gastown, [[Z-Space]]. Still based in Vancouver.

Here is a list of some [[2024 Events]] that I'm keeping track of / organizing / might attend. [[LOCALHOST]]

This is a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about):

> So a website with a link that says “**now**” goes to a page that tells you **what this person is focused on at this point in their life.** For short, we call it a “now page”.
