You may have heard that I'm [winding down](https://fission.codes/blog/farewell-from-fission/) [[Fission]] as of April 2024.

Going to see about [[Causal Islands]] regional events. First up, [[Causal Islands Berlin]].

I helped create a formal non-profit for [[Z-Space]] and am at my desk there most days.

Here is a list of some [[2024 Events]] that I'm keeping track of / organizing / might attend. 
* [[LOCALHOST]] in July in Vancouver
* I'm at [[DWeb Camp]] in early August, where I'm helping to run [[Emergent Day]]

This is a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about):

> So a website with a link that says “**now**” goes to a page that tells you **what this person is focused on at this point in their life.** For short, we call it a “now page”.
