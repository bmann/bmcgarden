- Robin Berjon is an expert in Web technology with over two decades’ worth of experience in both Web development and driving standardisation efforts, notably within [W3C](https://www.w3.org/). He was previously in charge of data governance at [The New York Times](https://nytimes.com/) where he works on advancing privacy and imagining a [capture-resistant](https://berjon.com/capture-resistance/) future of the Web.
- He lives in Princeton, USA with his spouse, two daughters, and a pair fluffy kittens. He has a fondness for ranting and rambling, especially in writing, but generally starts to feel self-conscious after writing a few sentences about himself in the third person.
