Another notes test. Now into the notes directory with a filename that is a date stamp, if I got formatting correct. I can keep typing here past the 280 character count, it just lets me know what the limit actually is.

The two cheat sheets for date formatting are:

[[strftime]], used in [[Liquid]] in [[Jekyll]] and in [[Ruby]].

[Devhints Date & Time Formats](https://devhints.io/datetime), which also has [[Moment.js]] formats.
