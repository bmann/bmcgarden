- From [[Primavera de Filippi]] via [Erlend on Noosphere Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1003419732516552724/1064430405563977748/1066683115910725673):
	- After reading Balaji's [[The Network State]], I have been growing increasingly concerned about the resonance that this book is having in various communities I'm part of. My hypothesis is that people are resonating with a higher-level concept (that of a post-westphalian, global community with the capacity for collective action) which can be instantiated in many different ways, including - but not limited to - the network state idea. So, I think we need to start a parallel endeavour to promote an alternative instantiation of this same higher-level concept. The current working definition of a communation is the following:
	  id:: 63cd6615-5499-4db9-b54f-538fdd0ff550
		- A communation is a voluntary community of individuals with a shared culture, principles and values, aligned through a common yet implicit agenda for achieving a shared societal vision.
		- A communation operates both at a local and global level, engaging in collective action in line with the principles of the commons, through collective governance and shared use of resources.
		- It has a collective identity that constitutes itself through self-sovereignty and self-determination, and is eventually recognized as such by other communations.
		- A communation exists along with existing nation states, adding new layers of sovereignties to domains that do not inherently belong to a territorial approach.
	- You can see the current working document where we are developing the concept [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TimmkfE2DCog1RVgyeo1AVOdEdGB_-I2ok2v0w10jvY/edit). We also started a podcast in collaboration with the Blockchain Socialist, on "Overthrowing the network state". ðŸ˜‰
	- Would love to hear your thoughts on this, and let me know if you want to join the effort !
