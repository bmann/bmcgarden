Automerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications.

Research work incubated by [[Ink & Switch]]

## Automatic Merging

Automerge is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type ([[CRDT]]), which allows concurrent changes on different devices to be merged automatically without requiring any central server.

## Network-agnostic

Use any connection-oriented network protocol: client-server, peer-to-peer, or local. Or use unidirectional messaging: send an Automerge file as an email attachment or store it on a file server.

## Portable

Implemented in [JavaScript](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) and [Rust](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-rs), with FFI bindings across platforms including iOS, Electron, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and more.
