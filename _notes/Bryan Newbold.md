> As of Spring 2023 I live in Seattle, at the [ELS](https://extraordinary.leastsquar.es/) household. I love the volcanoes in this region: climbing them, biking around them, snowboarding down them, paragliding around them, whatever. And the big wet mossy trees!
> 
> I work at [[Bluesky]], a startup company building a federated social media protocol called [[ATProtocol]]. Until a few months ago I worked at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) collecting scientific research datasets and publications, and created [scholar.archive.org](https://scholar.archive.org/). And before that I worked on infrastructure at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) in New York City, and built Atomic Magnetometers for a small New Jersey company called [Twinleaf](http://www.twinleaf.com/).
