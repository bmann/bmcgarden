- Railway vs Heroku

	- In the current era of software development, we feel that in some respects, needing to know #Docker to ship your app is too much boilerplate for the average developer. But, we still want to offer the developer all the benefits of reproducibility, speed, and ease of use when deploying images, hence why we built our builder called [[Nixpacks]]. It's open source https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks, and it's also swift. We detect more languages, builds are faster with the help of intelligent caching, and lastly, builds are reproducible. (A common frustration of #Buildpacks). Those moving from Heroku to Railway will find that we support the Heroku CNCF Buildpacks.
