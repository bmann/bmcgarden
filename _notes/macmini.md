title: Mac Mini
---

I bought a Mac Mini 2020[[Apple Canada <a href='https://www.apple.com/ca/mac-mini/'>Mac Mini page</a>::lmn]] at the [beginning of October 2020]({% link _posts/journal/2020-10-03-journal.md %}). I got the higher end model and bumped the processor to the **3.2GHz 6‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7**, but everything else base -- 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD.

32GB of RAM ordered from [OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/2666DDR4S32P/).

To research:
- External Webcam: [Wirecutter Webcam Reviews](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-webcams/). The Razer Kiyo Streaming Webcam comes with a built in ring light.
- External storage: for [[Filecoin]] blockchain syncing. The [Wirecutter External Desktop Hard Drive Reviews](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-external-desktop-hard-drive/) are going to be less useful for what I want to do. Some sort of enclosure and bare drives, I think?
- Keyboard: probably keep my [[Royal Kludge]]
- Mouse: I have a Logitech M535 Bluetooth mouse that's fine. Been thinking about a trackball[[Oh look, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-trackballs/'>Wirecutter reviews trackballs</a> too::rmn]] to make sure I don't get wrist problems, or maybe the Magic Trackpad for gesture support.
- Monitor: [Wirecutter's Best Monitors](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-monitors/) looks to have good options.
- Speakers: don't need any, I'll run headphones through the Blue Yeti Microphone I have
- [[eGPU]]: being researched
