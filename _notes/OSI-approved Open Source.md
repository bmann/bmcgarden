The [[OSI]] keeps a list of approved licenses. 

Fair licenses, non-commercial licenses, ethical licenses, and similar licenses are not approved.

For fair / non-commercial licenses that require businesses that make money to pay for a license, they don’t comply because they “discriminate” against businesses using the code without contributing back — [[Open Source Definition#6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor]]
