This is [[on device AI]], I use [[Local AI]] a little differently. 

Application deadline is August 1st, 2024.

> Our inaugural theme is Local AI, which focuses on running AI models and applications directly on personal devices such as laptops, smartphones, or edge devices, rather than relying on cloud-based services.
> 
> Local AI represents a transformative approach to AI deployment, providing significant benefits in terms of privacy, cost efficiency, cultural relevance, and system reliability.
>
