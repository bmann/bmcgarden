My personal Twitter Archive -- everything posted to [my @bmann Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bmann) -- is at <https://tweets.bmannconsulting.com>.

It is powered by Martin Hawksley's [[TAGS]].

I set it up a long time ago, and it has worked reliably ever since. It runs from my Google Account, is linked to my Twitter account to pull my Twitter archive[^twitterarchive], and then it publishes it to my Github account, which uses Github Pages to publish and host <https://tweets.bmannconsulting.com>.

Martin's post [[Keeping your Twitter Archive fresh and freely hosted on Github Pages]] has all the instructions to set this up for yourself.

[^twitterarchive]: The Twitter help center has an article that will walk you through where to get your archive export <https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive>
