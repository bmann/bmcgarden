The full blog post is titled [On Pioneers, Settlers, Town Planners and Theft](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html)  by [[Simon Wardley]].

The concept of Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners is something that I share with many people in thinking about their organizations. I learned it from Simon Wardley in the linked article, and have been sharing it ever since.
