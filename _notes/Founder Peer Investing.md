What if we helped educate founders and build the next generation of angel investors by investing small amounts into each others companies?

I pitched Ian Vanagas, author of [[Smart Young BC]], on this concept, and mentioned it to the [[Novus]] organizers. 

I’m going to figure out a date for running an initial session in Vancouver, that will probably look something like this:

* get a law firm sponsor to host in a boardroom
* do some light educational material about funding and company formation for first time founders
* have some pitch presentations and feedback 

Maybe we’ll only do the first two bullets and do a second session just for pitches. 

Perhaps a reboot / re-use of [[Venture Scouts]].
