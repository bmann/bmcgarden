Open Source Initiative
## About

> As steward of theÂ [[Open Source Definition]], we set the foundation for the open source software ecosystem.

> The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a California public benefit corporation, with 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, founded in 1998.

My take on [[OSI-approved Open Source]] is that it is harmful in gate keeping some approaches to open source.
