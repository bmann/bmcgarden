Canada needs a lot more housing. A lot of the housing in urban areas needs to be more dense, which means multiple stories, which means we have a requirement for elevators.

I've spent time in Germany, specifically Berlin, and see a lot of old buildings retrofitted with very basic elevators, which got me thinking about innovation and cost saving in local-to-Canada elevator construction.

Are there any elevators manufactured in Canada? Where do the parts come from? Can we supply all of our elevator needs locally? Are there "elevator innovations" to be done?

At this point, this idea is a thought experiment connected to original manufacturing and supply chains for things Canada needs.

Having now done 30 seconds of research, maybe [Delta Elevator](https://delta-elevator.com/), with a [manufacturing plant in Kitchener](https://delta-elevator.com/manufacturing.html) might just be part of what I was looking for.

Dropping this into a local Ollama model with the [[Caret]] plugin, it found a few more "local" manufacturers:

1. Delta Elevator (Ottawa, ON): As you mentioned, Delta Elevator is a family-owned business that has been designing and manufacturing elevators for over 30 years.
2. Baylis Elevator (Sault Ste. Marie, ON): Founded in 1984, Baylis Elevator is a Canadian-owned company that specializes in custom elevator design and manufacturing for commercial and industrial applications.
3. Elevon Elevators (Cambridge, ON): With over 20 years of experience, Elevon Elevators is a Canadian-owned company that designs and manufactures elevators for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.

Asked for ones west of Ontario, found these:

1. Elevator Technologies Inc. (Vancouver, BC): With over 30 years of experience, Elevator Technologies designs and manufactures custom elevators for commercial, residential, and industrial applications.
2. BC Elevator Company (Surrey, BC): Founded in the early 2000s, BC Elevator is a Canadian-owned company that specializes in designing and manufacturing elevators for new construction and modernization projects in British Columbia.
3. Alberta Elevator Corporation (Edmonton, AB): With over 40 years of experience, Alberta Elevator is a family-owned business that designs and manufactures custom elevators for commercial, residential, and industrial applications across Western Canada.
