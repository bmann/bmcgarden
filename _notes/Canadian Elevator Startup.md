Canada needs a lot more housing. A lot of the housing in urban areas needs to be more dense, which means multiple stories, which means we have a requirement for elevators.

I've spent time in Germany, specifically Berlin, and see a lot of old buildings retrofitted with very basic elevators, which got me thinking about innovation and cost saving in local-to-Canada elevator construction.

Are there any elevators manufactured in Canada? Where do the parts come from? Can we supply all of our elevator needs locally? Are there "elevator innovations" to be done?

At this point, this idea is a thought experiment connected to original manufacturing and supply chains for things Canada needs.

Having now done 30 seconds of research, maybe [Delta Elevator](https://delta-elevator.com/), with a [manufacturing plant in Kitchener](https://delta-elevator.com/manufacturing.html) might just be part of what I was looking for.
