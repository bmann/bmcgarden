- I want to talk about an idea I call fifth-generation management. 1/ ==Fifth-generation management is an emerging style of management we don’t know much about because it doesn’t actually exist yet== But it is guaranteed to emerge post-Covid because historically, big sharp disruptions have reliably triggered discontinuous changes in management culture, and it is already clear that this one is doing that.
- By [[vgr]] from his [[Breaking Smart]] newsletter
- Forwarded to me by @cambel, who also tagged @catthekin as starting to practice this fifth generation management. Feels like [[Wardley Maps]] fit in here as well, plus the [[Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners]] concepts. Well, just channeling [[Simon Wardley]] generally.
