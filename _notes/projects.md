I'm the CEO and co-founder of [[Fission]], which is where I spend the bulk of my time.

## Current Projects

* [[Venture Scouts]]
* [[AllTheBestRecipes]]
* [[Vancouver CLT]]

## Backlog

* [[Custom Bags in Vancouver]] -- I want to test my [[Ship IP Not Product]] ideas, and make a template for forming a group, designing a bag, and finding local makers and supply chain to make items locally, on demand
* [[Community ISP]] -- can we form co-ops and collectives and create community ISPs?
* [[Vancouver Local Makers Directory]] -- a list of made in [[Vancouver]] items, ideally with direct call to purchase
