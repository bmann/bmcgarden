I organized the first version of this in 2014, called Startup Week Vancouver at the time.

Other people stepped up in following years, including founding the Vancouver Startup Society as a non-profit association to run it.
## 2024

The VSW team reached out and asked if I wanted to host an event this year. With [[Ian Vanagas]], I'm hosting [[Smart Young BC VSW 2024]].

## Vancouver Startup Society

> The initiative is organized by the non-profit Vancouver Startup Society. We are proud to enjoy a relationship with Techstars, one of the premiere startup accelerator programs in the United States and whose great team coordinates Startup Weeks in every part of the globe.
