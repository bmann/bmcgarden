> The most flexible and powerful compute platform on any public cloud. Fly Machines are hardware-virtualized containers, running on our own hardware, that launch instantly and run exactly as long as you want them to â€” for a single HTTP request, or for weeks of uptime.

> Apps running on Fly Machines are KVM hardware-isolated, built on a memory-safe stack and running directly on our metal.
