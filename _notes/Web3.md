My definition of web3 from a technical perspective is that it is composed of <mark>self-verifying data structures, cryptography, and distributed systems</mark>. 

These are all active areas of research in computer science and information theory. 

Aside from technology, Web3 supports user ownership, data portability, open source, and public goods. 

The [[DWeb]] Principles are a good background.

Some of the ways of working look a lot like my [[Three Definitions of Open Source]].

Not all web3 has to be available under an open source license. Most often, I expect a Web3 system to be based on a protocol or standard, that can have multiple code implementations that interoperate by following the protocol. 

Some examples of Web3 systems:
* [[ATProtocol]], with [[Bluesky]] as an implementation 
* [[ActivityPub]], with [[Mastodon]] as an implementation 
* [[IPFS]], with [[Kubo]] as an implementation 
* [[Farcaster]], with [[Warpcast]] as a client

## Blockchain

Blockchains are a subset of web3. They are useful in cases where strict global consensus is required.
