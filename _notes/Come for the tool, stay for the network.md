- A popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call “come for the tool, stay for the network.”
  
  The idea is to initially attract users with a [single-player tool](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/) and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company.
- But starting a network from scratch is very hard. Think of single-player tools as kindling.
- [[Delicious]] and [[Instagram]] are given as examples
