Hi, I'm Boris Mann!

<!-- copy/paste from home page -->
I'm interested in [[Open Source Licensing]], community, co-operative models. Pooling capital and collaboration. I'm the founder of [[Fission]]. In Canada I help run the [[CoSocial]] Community Co-op. In Vancouver, I'm one of the organizers of [[DWebYVR]]. I like to cook & eat and have a [[FoodWiki]].

Some things I've been thinking about recently:

* [[pooling capital and collaboration]]
* [[Open source is no longer a radical act]]

There's a [[Colophon]] that covers how the website itself is built. [[BMC]] is a bit of a todo around website things.
