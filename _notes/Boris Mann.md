Hi, I'm Boris Mann!

<!-- copy/paste from home page -->
I'm interested in [[Open Source]], community, and [[co-op|co-operative]] models.

 In Canada I help run the [[CoSocial]] Community Co-op. In Vancouver, I'm one of the organizers of [[DWebYVR]] and help run the [[Z-Space]] non-profit society.

I've been exploring [[Cohousing]]. I like to cook & eat and have a [[FoodWiki]].

Some things I've been thinking about recently:

* [[pooling capital and collaboration]]
* [[Open source is no longer a radical act]]
* [[self-hosting is selfish]]
* [[Three Definitions of Open Source]]

I have a [[Now]] page.

There's a [[Colophon]] that covers how the website itself is built. [[BMC]] is a bit of a todo around website things.
## Meeting

I'm happy to [meet in person in Vancouver](https://cal.commonscomputer.com/boris/vancouver) or do an [intro video call](https://cal.commonscomputer.com/boris/30min).[^caldotcom] I'm working out of [[Z-Space]] most days.

[^caldotcom]: [[Commons Computer]] self-hosted [[Cal.com]] instance.

## Bio

An ever growing list of [[Bio]] notes of various lengths.
