- I have created a template for Static Site Publishing of single file #TiddlyWiki using #[[Github Actions]] https://github.com/bmann/tiddlywiki-static-publish [[TiddlyWiki Static Publish]]
- On mobile, I use [[Working Copy]] to check out the wiki
- [[Quine]] can edit the wiki and save the single file HTML wiki as normal
- Whenever you want to publish, use Working Copy to commit and push the wiki
- The GitHub action will build and publish
