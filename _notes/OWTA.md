In an age where technology significantly influences society, the Open WebTech Association (OWTA) is dedicated to promoting and advancing open web technologies, including but not limited to communication systems, advanced webtops, AI platforms, devops tools, and P2P services. As a community of forward-thinking developers, designers, and technology enthusiasts, we are committed to promoting transparency, inclusivity, and innovation in the development of web apps and solutions.

## Vision

Our vision is a digital landscape that is open and accessible to all, fostering an environment where innovation is cultivated and the free exchange of ideas is celebrated. We envision a world where web technologies empower individuals and communities, rather than constrain them, creating opportunities for growth and development across all sectors of society.

## Mission

The mission of the Open WebTech Association is to:

1. **Promote Open Standards:** Advocate for the use and development of open standards that ensure web technologies remain accessible, interoperable, and free from monopolistic constraints.
2. **Support Innovation:** Encourage the development of innovative web technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.
3. **Foster Community:** Build a supportive community of developers, designers, and users who share a passion for open web technologies and are committed to mutual growth and learning.
4. **Educate and Inform:** Provide resources, workshops, and forums that educate the public about the benefits of open web technologies and promote digital literacy.
