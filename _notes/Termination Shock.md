		  > Artificially putting sulfur into the stratosphere turns out to be the key plot device in Termination Shock. Delays by governments in addressing the climate crisis have a rich individual start to launch shells containing sulfur into the stratosphere. In a classic life imitating art moment, [Luke Iseman](https://twitter.com/liseman), the founder of [Make Sunsets](https://makesunsets.com/), is explicitly referring to reading Termination Shock as an inspiration for starting the company and releasing a first balloon carrying a tiny amount of sulfur into the stratosphere.
