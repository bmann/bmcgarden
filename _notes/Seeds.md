My digital garden is hosted at <https://notes.bmannconsulting.com>. Below are some pathways into the garden, and seeds of ideas and concepts. You can also browse the [note representing this page directly](https://notes.bmannconsulting.com/#/page/boris%20mann%20digital%20notes%20garden).

Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot.

> Software companies founded today are competing less with pen and paper than with other Internet-first incumbents. Put another way, as happens in every maturing industry before it, Internet company revenue will become zero-sum. As a corollary, the time between founding years of software startups and their competitive incumbents is shrinking:
