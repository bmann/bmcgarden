- Messaged [[Flancian]] about [[Moa Party]] [[Dec 27th, 2022]]
	- I think that the way that things are being run is no longer sustainable in the face of increased load and messages.
	- I’d like to transition away from the project myself
	- I’ve put 500 dollars in the open collective (or so — that was the lump sum)
	- What I’d like to do:
		- LATER use open collective funds to support a Docker setup and documentation #[[Moa Party]]
		- LATER have at least one other person who is an active Python dev and sysadmin to support the codebase / support you as sysadmin on the main gateway #[[Moa Party]]
		- LATER do a “call for gateways” and document other gateways that are running other than the main one #[[Moa Party]]
