- > A fishbowl conversation is a form of dialogue that can be used when discussing topics within large groups. Fishbowl conversations are sometimes also used in participatory events such as #unconferences. The advantage of fishbowl is that it allows the entire group to participate in a conversation. Several people can join the discussion.
- Have 5 seats and a moderator. 4 seats are filled and one is left open.
- The 4 speakers discuss, and if the audience has something to say, they come down and occupy the empty chair, and the speaker who has been there the longest leaves their seat and rejoins the audience
