Robert Merki does a great job of defining a Wildcard person:

> A Wildcard is a person who can take on many different roles as needed. They are fundamentally problem solvers who enjoy tackling new challenges. A Wildcard's role at any given time is dictated by the problem that needs solving.
>
> These people thrive in early stage startups, and not all have the desire to be CEO. Most just enjoy the challenge of doing new stuff.

I consider myself a Wildcard and tend to be good at identifying them.
