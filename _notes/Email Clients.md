I’m a long time [[Missive]] user for work, and I’m looking for a new email client and/or new email workflows to adopt.  

I host my email on a paid Google plan, but am exploring different options like self hosting with [[Cloudron]], or picking a paid [[Fastmail]] account. 

I’ll tag [[Freescout]] as a self-hosted tool I’m getting more experience with for shared inboxes. 

As an individual user, Google works fine and lets me use Google account linked services. 

For an organization / group / non-profit it immediately becomes quite expensive to run emails and calendaring. But that’s a longer discussion. 

Below, some clients that I’m trying out.

* I’d like to have an iOS native client 
* Needs to have great snooze support — send an email with a “snooze” reminder that puts it back in the inbox after 2 business days if no one has replied 

Everything else is nice to have, but basically I’m picky about the look / feel. 
## [Shortwave](https://www.shortwave.com/)

Freemium plans but includes “Sent with Shortwave” for every email. 

Paid plans are $7/user/annually for personal inboxes (gmail.com or .edu), or $14/user/annually for Google Workspace account support. 

Has some AI features for search and compose.
