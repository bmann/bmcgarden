- Made a Signal Group for general chat and for organizers
- Recommend [[Namecheap]] or [[Google/Domains]] for DNS registrar — [[GoDaddy]] is definitely bad!
- [[Ghost]] is like an open source [[Substack]], can also do email newsletters
	- ((63af4c6d-fbfc-4252-8d33-772b733210f3))
- [[Telegram]] is very much crypto aligned — which tools and platforms get picked definitely do say something
- [[GitLab]] has pretty great features like email-to-issue-queue
- But really [[Github]] is still the main “social” platform for devs
- Yes we should start an [[Open Collective]] — talk to [[Hypha]] about being a fiscal host
- We need a code of conduct. The DWeb Principles are also excellent to review and include.
- Landing page with links to everything on GitHub
	- Maybe [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]] and it can be a wiki as well
	- Editing with [[Obsidian]] and teach people “just enough GitHub”?
	- Or [[TinaCMS]] or something
- Separate inboxes works best for Emily. Email forwarding, or full Fastmail? Don’t want to incur GSuite account costs. Or necessarily use more Google.
	- Maybe other DWeb Nodes have email?
	- Or: shared [[Cloudron]] instance?
	- Or: maybe [[CanTrust Hosting Coop]] can sponsor email hosting?
- Volunteers per event as part of bootstrapping more conveners?
	- Learning by doing, recruiting
- TODO Create a GitHub org #dwebyvr
- TODO Write up notes in HackMD #dwebyvr
