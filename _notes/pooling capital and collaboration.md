Pooling capital and collaboration

I'm using this phrase to talk about a foundational concept and approach to working together.

Capital can of course mean money, but also social, reputational, land, and other forms of capital. 

And getting anything done with groups of people needs collaboration. More people, more collaboration. Which is hard. Hard to get started and hard to keep going.

For me, it spans work I’ve done from open source communities, code collaboration, startup accelerators, and venture funding. I’m digging into Cohousing, and Co-op and Collective models.
