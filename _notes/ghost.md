Ghost is an open source blogging and publishing platform.

More recently, it's been calling itself a [[Headless CMS]]. You can use Ghost for its admin and editing interface for making blog posts and pages, and then use a different framework such as [[11ty]][^11tyghost] on the front end to customize and display the content.

[^11tyghost]: I've used the [Eleventy Ghost Starter Kit](https://github.com/bmann/eleventy-starter-ghost) to connect to [[Fission]]'s Ghost blog https://blog.fission.codes. The example is at https://obtuse-enormous-canvas-eagle.fission.app/.

Ghost is now also being compared to [[Substack]], it has a [Ghost vs. Substack Comparison Page](https://ghost.org/vs/substack/). This is powered by [Ghost's membership / subscription features](https://ghost.org/members/).

## About Ghost

Ghost was created from initial Kickstarter funding in 2013. It is now run through the non-profit Ghost Foundation, whose main source of revenue is Ghost Pro -- professional hosting of the Ghost software. The metrics for the foundation are all public.

> We set Ghost up as non-profit foundation so that it would always be true to its users, rather than shareholders or investors. Our legal constitution ensures that the company can never be bought or sold, and one hundred percent of our revenue is reinvested into the product and the community.
> 
> As a public organisation we also believe in being transparent and accountable for everything we do, so we publish our live financial data for all to see.

Their label for this model is Sustainable Open Source:
> The more people who use Ghost, the more customers we have, the more revenue we receive, the more great people we can hire to work for the foundation, the better the software gets, the more people use Ghostâ€¦ and so on.
>
> It's a virtuous cycle which means that we can keep creating open, adaptable software with a vibrant future, forever.
