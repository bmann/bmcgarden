- The full blog post is titled [On Pioneers, Settlers, Town Planners and Theft](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html) from 2015.
- The concept of Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners is something that I share with many people in thinking about their organizations. I learned it from Simon Wardley in the linked article, and have been sharing it ever since.
- I find it a really useful way to think about the role of people within an organization, and what a person is best suited for. I am a Pioneer-to-Settler kind of guy.
- Simon has written about the concept much earlier than the linked 2015 post (circa 2005 - 2006), including this article where he sources it back to [[Robert X. Cringely]]'s [[Accidental Empires]] book, where it is called _Commandos, Infantry, and Police_ http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/11/bimodal-it-is-long-hand-for-snafu.html

		  * Pioneers "most likely to build a partially functioning 3D printer with Lego"
		  * Settlers "most likely to steal a half baked Lego 3D printer and turns it into something that lots of people want to buy"
		  * Town Planners "most likely to be running the factory which builds Lego bricks and Lego kits"
- [[Jeff Atwood]] aka Coding Horror / Stack Overflow / Discourse wrote by about that way back in 2004, also connecting it to #[[Accidental Empires]] book: https://blog.codinghorror.com/commandos-infantry-and-police
	- > As I was driving home, I found myself thinking about a favorite section of the book [[Accidental Empires]] , by longtime computer journalist Robert X. Cringely. Originally published in 1993, it's getting a little long in the tooth, but it still contains a lot of great insights about the personalities that drove innovation in silicon valley â€“ from a guy who personally knew many of the players.
