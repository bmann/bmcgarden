What does open source mean in 2019? Is it a legal innovation centered on licensing? Is it a way of working â€” collaborative peer production around the globe?

How should blockchain and other Web3 technology building blocks be thinking about open source, and what is their relationship to the open source movement?

Do open source supporters need to evolve the mission, and tackle topics such as data ownership and sovereign identity?

Boris will cover these questions and more, as he examines open source past, present, and future, especially in the context of new Web3 building blocks.
