- The following is intended as a starting point, a first draft towards establishing a shared charter that would serve to protect, support, and enrich the nascent Fediverse.
- This text is intended to be received in the spirit of iteration and is presented absent any fundamentalism about the ideas within. We don't have great tools for usable decentralized collaboration on text, so while I have misgivings about placing it in a space that is only accessible by engineers, it is available to be [forked](https://github.com/blaine/slocan-statement).
- I encourage anyone to use this text as a basis for their own statement, but my hope is that we can build towards a collective statement for the whole fediverse. I encourage the use of the **#SlocanStatement** hashtag on the Fediverse if you post a derivative work elsewhere.
