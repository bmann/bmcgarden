The "." (dot) files where the configuration for your shell, editors, apps, and other system tools live.

Github has [an unofficial guide to dotfiles dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io) where you can see what other people are using.

I'm just in the midst of rebooting my dotfiles and switching to [[chezmoi]] as the tool for managing them.
