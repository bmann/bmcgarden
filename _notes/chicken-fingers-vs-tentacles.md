title: Chicken Fingers Vs. Tentacles
---
Purely having a list of my recommendations, or a list of my favourites, won't itself encode the context of my preferences in order to be usefully make "my friends like" style recommendations.

This is one of my original sayings that I now abbreviate as shorthand. The example is about restaurant recommendations, but can apply to anything where people have preferences.

## Restaurant Recommendation Example

If I enjoy a lot of different and adventurous kinds of food -- I'm more on the "Tentacles" side of the scale of trying out new things at restaurants -- then I won't actually be able to give you good recommendations if you are on the "chicken fingers" end of the scale.

Knowing more about you and your preferences, and also having experience or relevant expertise around an area like food and restaurants, I may be able to recommend "chicken fingers" compatible options.
