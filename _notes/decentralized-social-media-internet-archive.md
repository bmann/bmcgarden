The [[Internet Archive]] hosted the [[DWeb SF Meetup]] on [[January 20th, 2020]]. The [blog post titled 'Our Social Media is Broken. Is Decentralization the Fix?'](http://blog.archive.org/2020/01/30/our-social-media-is-broken-is-decentralization-the-fix/) has a great summary with links to all of the people and resources mentioned in the video below.

It start's by mentioning [[Jack Dorsey]] and Twitter's [[Bluesky]] project.

[[Jay Graber]] kicked off the event:

> Graber helped us understand the broad categories of what’s out there: federated protocols such as [[ActivityPub]] and [[Matrix]]; peer-to-peer protocols such as [[Scuttlebutt]], and social media apps that utilize blockchain in some way for  monetization, provenance or storage. What was clear from Graber’s talk was that she had tested and used dozens of tools, from Mastodon to [[Iris]], Martti Malmi’s new P-2-P social app and she deftly laid out the pros and cons of each.
