- For several years now, I’ve been watching the creeping, unheralded growth of what I call the cozyweb, and for which [others have lots of creative names](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1131963928685080577)
	- We need a good name for this. Darkweb is drug dealers. Underground sounds narrower and more politically subversive than this is. This is mostly just a private web, a sort of domestic-backyards intranet.

- Kickstarter founder Yancey Strickler called it the Dark Forest in a recent post. [[The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet]]
- Unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot.
