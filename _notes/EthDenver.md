## 2024

This is actually my first time at EthDenver! There are several people who thought I'd been here in the past :)

It's a pretty giant event now, mostly around many many side events.

I'm here with Ryan from the [[Fission]] team, talking to potential users and partners for [[Everywhere Computer]].
