## Trustworthy Custom Applications

[Github README](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/emissary)

> As a developer, Emissary empowers you to build custom, social applications in a simple, declarative, **low-code environment**. Using only HTML templates and a JSON config file, you can create full-featured social apps that are easy to deploy and easy to maintain.
> 
> This is done by building action pipelines out of simple, composable steps, like: "show an edit form", "create a thumbnail", and "save the object". Pipelines work alongside Emissary's built-in state machines and access permissions to form robust and secure applications that you and your end-users can trust.
