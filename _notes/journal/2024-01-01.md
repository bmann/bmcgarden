I started writing this as a blog post, before realizing that I can just use a journal entry for it!

I didn't get much blog tinkering done over the holidays, other than just barely opening my code editor and making a new branch, deciding to delete my archive from this site, and see if [[Obsidian]] can work for what it's intended to be: a fancy Markdown editor!
## Obsidian
I've long "held out" against Obsidian. I tried it, it was fine, but after many years of rolling my own sites with [[Jekyll]] and [[Markdown]] it didn't feel like much of a difference.

I _want_ the type of graph structure that [[LogSeq]] and other advanced systems do, with full block based systems, not just pages of Markdown on disk.

But! Pages of Markdown on disk does accurately describe what I do when I'm working on this site, especially on desktop.

We're also using Obsidian at [[Fission]] as of December 2023, for our product planning process. We bought licenses for the whole team and are using git for [[multiplayer]].

## IndieKit

I've gone back and forth on using [[IndieKit]]. The main thing it brings is a [[Micropub]] interface for mobile posting to this site. And with LogSeq not really working for me for that, and Noosphere not being quite ready, maybe I bring back journals here.

I've been using and paying for [[Micro.blog]] for this for my [personal blog](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com), and I've been enjoying the cross posting -- posts get sent to Bluesky and Mastodon (and Nostr and Tumbler and LinkedIn).

## Cloudron
I'm going to make a [[Cloudron]] page here, because I've been learning and experimenting and raving about it for 3 months or so.

I had tried it some time ago and recently re-committed to it in a big way. I've got a personal install I call the [[Commons Computer]], installed it for [[CoSocial]], installed it for [[Fission]], and have an [[IPFS]] community one that isn't quite active yet.

## LogSeq (and Noosphere and Linkding and...)
What about my [notes site](https://notes.bmannconsulting.com) powered by [[LogSeq]]? Do I ... migrate all the notes back here? it's probably a good idea to have a separate notes site which is more ephemeral than this. But maybe everything is ephemeral???

The other other thing I meant to do over the holidays was install the commandline [[Noosphere]] tooling. I'm in the beta, so have the [[Subconscious]] iOS app, and being able to perhaps use Noosphere for syncing between desktop and mobile would be good, without doing the [[Working Copy]] git client on my phone.

And finally, I have a [shared bookmarking service Linkding installed on Commons Computer](https://commonscomputer.com/t/linkding-installed/25). You can browse [shared bookmarks here](https://links.commonscomputer.com/bookmarks/shared). Do I need another place to stash bookmarks? Part of the thinking of IndieKit and Journals on this site, is that notes-as-bookmarks / journals-with-links are a good place for them, and yet another service is just another spot for them to never get looked at again.

## Eleventy
One of the other solutions for how long it takes to build this site, and perhaps for more advanced "stuff", is perhaps to move it to [[Eleventy]]. But that's going to take a lot more coding and learning time, although I did [capture some Eleventy bookmarks](https://links.commonscomputer.com/bookmarks/shared?q=%23eleventy).
