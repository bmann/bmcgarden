From the [GIthub README](https://github.com/azukaar/cosmos-server):
> Cosmos is the most secure and easy way to self-host a Home Server. It acts as a secure gateway to your application, as well as a server manager. It aims to solve the increasingly worrying problem of vulnerable self-hosted applications and personal servers.

## Install

Via Docker, so you need to have a system where Docker is already installed.

## Comparison with others

The Github README has this image of a comparison graph:

So, comparing to [[Unraid]], [[Yunohost]], [[CasaOS]], and [[Cloudron]].
