	- > Firstly, audio from Craig is always delivered as multiple files, with each file representing a single speaker. This is called multi-track recording (a single stream of audio is called a “track”), and is Craig's primary feature. This is extremely useful, as you can edit or cut parts of each track independently. If one speaker is too quiet, you can increase their volume without affecting anyone else; if another speaker keeps coughing, you can remove that without removing anyone's speech. Ultimately, you will probably need to use an audio editor to mix these tracks into a single audio stream. There are many audio editors in the world, and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a popular, free one.
