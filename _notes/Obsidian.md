A [[Tools for Thought]] app focused on local editing of [[Markdown]] files.
## License

Obsidian doesn't use [[Open Source Licensing]]. It's effectively a non-commercial license, labeled as "free for personal use":

> Obsidian is free for personal and non-profit use. However, if you use Obsidian for work-related activities that generate revenue in a company with two or more people, you must purchase a commercial license for each user. Non-profit organizations are exempt from this requirement.
> <https://obsidian.md/license>

Later on, it clarifies that single users can use it under a no-charge license, even for work:

> **De Minimis Commercial Use License**, for sole-proprietorships and single-person organizations

And finally, the [Catalyst license](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license) is a one-time charge to support development, with early access and insider builds.

## Features

### Transclusion

Obsidian just calls this [embedding a file](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files), and the syntax is putting an ! in front of regular linking. There’s a special syntax for naming lists. 

My setup of [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]] doesn’t currently render these embeds.
