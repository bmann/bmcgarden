Open source, Apache licensed cloud spreadsheet. Not quite an Airtable clone, but similar capabilities. Some of the layout and linking makes it feel like Filemaker.

> Grist is a modern relational spreadsheet. It combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the robustness of a database.

Grist is a hybrid database/spreadsheet, meaning that:

- Columns work like they do in databases: they are named, and they hold one kind of data.
- Columns can be filled by formula, spreadsheet-style, with automatic updates when referenced cells change.

There is a [user-created packaging of Grist](https://git.cloudron.io/walski/grist-app) for [[Cloudron]].

## Grist essentials

1. **Relational database**Â thatâ€™s easy to create and use by non-technical people.
2. **Data/view**Â separation, for app-like functionality, easy to set up and use by non-technical people.
3. Sharing andÂ **access controls**Â that allow users to address complex real-world access requirements.
4. **Open source**, for transparency and trust in the softwareâ€™s promises, and freedom for technical users to improve it.Â [Read more](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-a-hacker-friendly-spreadsheet/)Â on this.
5. Options to runÂ **self-managed**, or on the desktop; reliance on a service provider is optional.
6. Support for spreadsheet-likeÂ **formulas**, to extend use cases and empower users.
7. Extensibility viaÂ **APIs**Â and other integration points.
8. Data isÂ **portable**, allowing lossless export in a well-supported format, and common export/import options.
9. ComprehensiveÂ **documentation**Â and learning materials.
10. **High quality**Â implementation, well-tested, with a focus on reliability and performance.
## Grist Labs

From Github README:

> TheÂ `grist-core`Â repo is the heart of Grist, including the hosted services offered byÂ [Grist Labs](https://getgrist.com/), an NYC-based company ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ and Grist's main developer. The French government agencyÂ [ANCT DonnÃ©es et Territoires](https://donnees.incubateur.anct.gouv.fr/toolbox/grist)Â ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· has also made significant contributions to the codebase.
