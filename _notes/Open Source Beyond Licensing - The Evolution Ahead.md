title: Open Source Beyond Licensing - The Evolution Ahead
---
**Open source is no longer a radical act.** From legal innovation to ways of working remotely and collaboratively, the past 20 years have integrated it as a common baseline.

Can we get maintainers paid, make open source a job, and work alongside new tools like AI?

What new licenses, ways of working, and principles power the next 20 years?

This ended up being perhaps a bit licensing heavy, but people seem to enjoy the material and learn a bit of history, emerging licenses, and so on.

The presentation below is exported from Keynote and the links are clickable, but you can also explore the links I've mentioned directly:

* Ted Leung, [Explaining Commons Based Peer Production](https://www.sauria.com/py-bin/pyblosxom/pyblosxom.cgi/computers/open_source/1233.html)
* [[Open Source Definition]] by the [[OSI]]. See also my take on [[OSI-approved Open Source]]
* From [[Kyle Mitchell]], [Copyleft Intolerance and the Defining-Open Mind Trap](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2023/12/16/Intolerance-Copyleft-Definition)
* [Parity License](https://paritylicense.com/)
* [Prosperity License](https://prosperitylicense.com/)
* My general [[Open Source Licensing]] page has more on this
* [996.icu](https://996.icu)
* [[Big Time License]]
* [Polyform Standardized Licenses](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/)
* [[Blue Oak Council]], including their "gold" list of permissive licenses
* Dries Buytaert, [Balancing Makers and Takers to Scale and Sustain Open Source](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source)
* Still working on this, but [[Permissive Licenses and Fenced Community]]
* Examples of commercial open source with some form of enterprise license or other restrictions:
	* [[Cal.com]]
	* [[Posthog]]
	* [[Outline]]
* Tools you should know about for collecting fees, donations, license sales, consulting, etc.
	* [[Open Collective]]
	* [[Polar]]
* These two articles are relatively brand new, and what I'm sharing for thinking about AI and software development:
	* [[Steve Yegge]], [[Death of the Junior Developer]]
	* [[Maggie Appleton]], [[Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers]]

Not included in the presentation, but [[Open Source is a restaurant]] is a useful related read on how think about paying for open source.

The concept of [[open source as a job]] is predicated on more global participation in software.

In discussion, I mentioned [[Situational Awareness]] set of essays as American propaganda, but important to understand for AI future directions.
