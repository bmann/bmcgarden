Available on many platforms, including mobile apps and even terminal. Uses different cloud services for synchronization, but encrypted with your own keys, eg [[Dropbox]].[[I don't use it any more. I'm using <a href='../roam-research/'>Roam</a> for private notes and its mobile web interface works fine for quick note taking.::lmn]]
