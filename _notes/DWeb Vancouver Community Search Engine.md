I'm prototyping [[Community Search Engine]] by building one for Vancouver.

---

Communities form around a number of things. One is online / regional community such as [[DWebYVR]] (Signal channel, DWeb Discord, Wiki, etc), another is around events, e.g. Causal Islands or DWeb Camp.

Online communities, especially those around a chat powered by Discord, Signal, Telegram, etc., have terrible built in search where things aren't very browseable or discoverable.

Event based communities have lots of rich content -- speakers, their talks, links and pointers in the talks themselves -- but this is usually left behind and not carried forward each year. As well, the attendees themselves, and their personal or work websites, and their social media, also contain great information, but aren't captured at all.

## Prototyping

[[Lieu]] is a basic community search engine and webring tool. We're going to use it to prototype the experience.

[[Graham Fleming]] is volunteering to see about getting Lieu running on [[Railway]]. 

The [LOCALHOST DWeb webring repo](https://github.com/DWebYVR/localhost_vancouver_webring) has a lieu config file as well as a basic HTML website at [localhost.dwebvancouver.org](https://localhost.dwebvancouver.org). This is being published via Github Actions to Github Pages.
