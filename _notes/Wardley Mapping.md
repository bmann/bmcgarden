Wardley Maps are a method created by [[Simon Wardley]] to review and develop strategy around business and markets. 

One of the base concepts is that new innovations go from invention / genesis where everything is custom and bespoke through to commodity / utility. 

Genesis -> Custom Built -> Product (Rental / SaaS) -> Commodity (Utility)

He originally developed this around the evolution of cloud computing.

The [[Pioneers, Settlers, and Town Planners]] shows the mapping of personality types to stages of evolution / approaches needed for each stage.
