Capabilities adoption needs a lot more education and promotion.

## Interest in Capabilities

There are currently three communities that are interested / active in capabilities: [[LoFi|Local First]], Crypto/Blockchain, and Capabilities enthusiasts.

Academics are broadly interested, as are practitioners in [[Programming Language Theory]] (PLT) and [[Distributed Systems]].
## List of Groups / Companies / People

TODO turn this into a typed list.
## Capabilities Evolution

![](/assets/2024/capabilties_evolution.jpeg)

E-rights language leads to strict [[Object-capability model]] that Agoric and Spritely are digging into. [[SPKI]] / SDSI / X.509 are [[Certificate capabilities]], which is [[UCAN]] and friends. [[Authomerge]] is a little bit of both.
## CapCon

When is the right time to have a "Capabilities Conference"?

What do we want to accomplish out of having an in person conference?
* talks that are recorded
* discussion about?
* interop / plug fest

Feels [[LoFi|Local First]] and [[Causal Islands]] related. TODO: do a scan of events coming up.

 * they currently appear to be quite strict, e.g. don't want to include UCAN
