title: ChromeOS

[[ChromeOS]] is the operating system, based on Gentoo Linux, that runs on Chromebooks.

Since I've been using Chromebooks since before they supported Linux natively, there are a variety of notes here related to using ChromeOS "natively" by putting your Chromebook into developer mode.

Today, you should use [[ChromeOS Linux Support]] instead. This is similar to how [[WSL]] works on Windows.
