File encryption tool & format

git: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age

"A simple, modern and secure encryption tool with small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability."

Meant to replace the use of gpg for encrypting files, backups, streams, etc. Implementations in [[GoLang]] and [[Rust]].
