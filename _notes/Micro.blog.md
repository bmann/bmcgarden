Website: <https://micro.blog>

A blogging platform that supports [[Micropub]]. 

The core feature is hosting your blog there for $5/month. The $10/month plan adds podcast hosting, video hosting, bookmarks with archiving of bookmarked pages, and sending out posts by email.

It supports aggregating multiple different RSS or JSON Feeds and either importing them into your blog, or just merging them into your Micro.blog feed. 

Feeds can be cross-posted to different networks, including:

* [[Mastodon]]
* [[Bluesky]]
* [[Medium]]
* [[LinkedIn]]
* [[Nostr]]
* [[Tumblr]]
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Pixelfed]]

Your Micro.blog account can also be activated as an [[ActivityPub]] account directly.
