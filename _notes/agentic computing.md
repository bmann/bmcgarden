Distributed applications and compute which delegate between each other.

I’m purposefully making a narrow definition here and thinking about [[Capabilities Adoption]] — hence the word delegation — rather than a much broader, AI- and future-facing design  that can autonomously pursue complex goals and workflows with minimal direct human supervision. 

The term agentic for me should mean self-ownership of data and the ability to sub-delegate without a centralized system in the middle.
