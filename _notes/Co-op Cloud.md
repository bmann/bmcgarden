> Co-op Cloud aims to make hosting libre software apps simple for small service providers such as tech co-operatives who are looking to standardise around an open, transparent and scalable infrastructure. It uses the latest container technologies and configurations are shared into [the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) for the benefit of all.

> The project was started by workers at [Autonomic](https://autonomic.zone/) which is a [worker-owned co-operative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative). We provide technologies and infrastructure to empower users to make a positive impact on the world. We're using Co-op Cloud in production, amongst other systems.

> The core technologies of Co-op Cloud are libre software and enjoy wide adoption across software developer communities.

_**@boris commentary:** it's unclear whether Docker swarm IS going to keep going. One of the sites they link to, dockerswarm.rocks, has a [kubernetes won](https://dockerswarm.rocks/swarm-or-kubernetes/) post. The [awesome-swarm](https://github.com/BretFisher/awesome-swarm) appears to continue to be updated._

Their [FAQ](https://docs.coopcloud.tech/intro/faq/) has a really good section on comparing to other solutions, which I’m reproducing at [[Co-op Cloud Alternatives]]
