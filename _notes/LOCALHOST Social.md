The Thursday social part of [[LOCALHOST]] on July 25th, 2024, at Osito on W Hastings. Luma page: https://lu.ma/b9p075ag

## IETF

We had several people from the [[IETF]] attend and answer some questions, including shouting out RFCs from the audience / stage with PvG from Orcfax.

This was really great and ended up showcasing "the Internet" as something that isn't just built in the US, in California.

## Vancouver Energy Community Groups

I pushed [[Vancouver Energy]] on stage, and called up some of the people involved with groups on stage, and also had people come up to talk about and pitch their own projects.

[Glen Lougheed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glougheed/) also pitched a connection between older startup entrepreneurs and younger startups, stay tuned to more info about that.

I have some of these items linked as full pages here in my library, but I'll work to put this in the [[DWeb Vancouver Community Search Engine]] at [localhost.dwebvancouver.org](https://localhost.dwebvancouver.org).
