## RSS Feeds
[[There is no feed for the <a href='/archive/'>Archive</a> other than newer blog posts. I don't intend to create a feed for my <a href='/journal/'>Journal</a>, you can come by and visit the site if you really want a peek.::lmn]]
**Recently Updated Notes** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/notes.xml"><img src="../assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

Notes are the main wiki pages that I create here. This feed is sorted by last modified date, so items you've seen before will show up again when I re-edit them with more info. The [Notes](/notes/) page shows the same thing in human readable form.

**Recent Links** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/links.xml"><img src="../assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

Anything with a link field. Mostly comes in two flavours. One is a kind of bookmark, that links to an app, or open source tool, or a website that I want to keep track of and perhaps write a few things about. The second is an Article, where I take notes and quote pieces of it that I find interesting. The [Links](/links/) page shows both kinds.

**Blog** <a href="https://bmannconsulting.com/feed/blog.xml"><img src="../assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a>

The home page and the [Blog](/blog/) page list recent blogs.[[Blogging is slow and infrequent in these parts. I'm busy updating notes instead! The <a href='https://blog.bmannconsulting.com'>blog</a> has more frequent short posts, images, and such. <a href="https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/feed.xml"><img src="../assets/orange-square.svg" style="height: 1.1em;" class="inline"></a> ::rmn]]
