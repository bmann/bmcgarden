Community Search Engine is the label for a set of approaches to interconnect communities. 

These communities are formed by:

* Events such as conferences
* Digital spaces, such as a Discord server

These are often communities of interest, but can also considered to be trust relationships: if you are connected to a group of people you may extend trust to other recommendations they make. 
## Reading 

[[Dark Forest and Cozy Web]]: communities are moving to cozy web spaces, and/or have need for members only content. The open internet has degraded search incentivized by click throughs to show ads, and commercial social platforms

[[Brazilianization of the Internet]]: forming communities, which can be considered a kind of commons, do exclude or make [[cozyweb]] spaces. Does this cause a kind of elitism, and/or further deteriorate public spaces?

[[How Algolia uses Electron to improve internal productivity]]: Iâ€™m still inspired by this description of Algolia implementing company wide search across internal tools, with desktop integration. This should be a tool for organizations of all kinds.

## Local

I applied to [[SoP 2024 Application]] with some ideas around this that has some longer writing.

Part of community is "flow" ([[Stock and Flow]]) and [[Proto Apps]] is how I think social graphs / communities / flows of information form.

[[Open Social Protocols]] is what are part of the building blocks for all of this.
## Tools

[[Lieu]] is an example of some code that helps build community search engines and webrings.
