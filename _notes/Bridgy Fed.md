[Docs](https://fed.brid.gy/docs)

> Bridgy Fed is a decentralized social network bridge. It connects the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), the [web](https://indieweb.org/), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/). If you're on one of these networks, you can use Bridgy Fed to follow people on other networks, see their posts, and reply and like and repost them. Likewise, they'll be able to see you and your posts too.
