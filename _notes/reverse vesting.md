It's called "reverse vesting", because founder's shares are granted at company formation (so not in fact vested), and there is a base agreement that says that the company can buy back a portion of or all shares -- e.g. the company "reverse" vests the right to be able to buy back founder shares at nominal cost.

> Tech startups usually grant shares subject to vesting conditions ([or use options](http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/stock-options/)) in order to solve the [problem of a founder leaving and taking their shares with them](http://genius.com/Kirsty-nathoo-lecture-18-mechanics-legal-finance-hr-etc-annotated). The shares are either issued immediately subject to the company buying the shares back later under certain conditions (a reverse vesting agreement) or are granted over time (a vesting agreement).

> The decision as to vesting vs. reverse vesting is largely tax-driven but granting shares immediately may make stakeholders feel like they're more of a team (there's a big emotional aspect to starting a company). In Canada, the potentially massive tax advantage to getting shares upfront (i.e. reverse vesting) is [taking advantage of the $750k lifetime capital gains exemption for CCPCs](http://business.financialpost.com/2013/10/16/plan-to-take-full-advantage-of-business-owners-capital-gains-exemption/) (talk to your accountant).
