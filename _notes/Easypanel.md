> Under the hood, Easypanel utilizes [[Docker Swarm]]. Our newest implementation now enables you to add multiple worker nodes. When deploying services, the workload will be evenly distributed across all your servers. If you happen to remove a worker node, the workload from that server will be automatically redistributed amongst the remaining nodes.
