Right now, it's just my fork of the [[Simply Jekyll]] theme [[bmann/simply-jekyll::https://github.com/bmann/simply-jekyll/]].

I've done an initial setup of [[Forestry]] with it, and have it building to [[Netlify]]. My plan is to turn it into a Github template repository[[Github's <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository'>docs on template repos</a> isn't great. It's to make a copy without forking that is ready to go right away.::rsn]], to make it very simple for people to run.

The theme itself is a bit too complicated and custom, so consider this an experiment.
