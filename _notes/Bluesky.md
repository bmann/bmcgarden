- The organization behind the [[AT Protocol]]
- From the [home page](https://blueskyweb.xyz/):
	- > The web. Email. RSS feeds. XMPP chats. What all these technologies had in common is they allowed people to freely interact and create content, without a single intermediary.
	  > We‘re building the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), a new foundation for social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience.

	- [[Mar 6th, 2023]] [Domain Names as Handles in Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky)
		- Here’s why we’ve designed the AT protocol to let you join a social network with a custom domain and prioritized it as a feature in Bluesky:
			- **You can tell which accounts are authentic based on the websites they’re associated with.**
				- Custom domain handles are a decentralized way for us to achieve a level of account verification. Curious if “@potus.bsky.social” is actually the president of the US? Once this feature fully lands, you should assume the actual president of the US would have an official domain handle like “@potus.whitehouse.gov”.
			- **You can use the same handle to identify you across social media services.**
				- I own jaygraber.com, so if I set my handle to @jaygraber.com on Bluesky, I can tell my friends to find me at this stable handle across any AT Protocol social site that supports custom domains.
			- **You can keep a custom domain handle when you switch services.**
				- If you’re currently using the bsky.social service we’re running, but you decide you don’t like our policies and want to switch to another, you’ll be able to keep the same domain handle.
