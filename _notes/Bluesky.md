> We‘re building the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), a new foundation for public conversation and social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience.

The company is a Public Benefit Corporation that created the [[ATProtocol]] and built and runs the [Bluesky microblogging platform](https://baky.app).
