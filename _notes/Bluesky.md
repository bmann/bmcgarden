> We‘re building the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), a new  foundation for public conversation and social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience.

The company is a Public Benefit Corporation that created the [[ATProtocol]] and built and runs the [Bluesky microblogging platform](https://baky.app).

[[Tim Bray]]  collected [Facts and opinions about Bluesky](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/04/28/Bluesky) because so many people were hating on it, mostly with misinformation. 

## Custom Feeds

From the [docs](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds):

> Custom feeds, or feed generators, are services that provide custom algorithms to users through the AT Protocol. This allows users to choose their own timelines, whether it's an algorithmic For You page or a feed of entirely cat photos.
> 
> This is a starter kit for creating feed generators on atproto. It's not feature complete, but should give you a good starting ground off of which to build and deploy a feed.
> 
> You can skip this tutorial and clone the TypeScript starter template directly [here](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator), or use community templates in [Python](https://github.com/MarshalX/bluesky-feed-generator) or [Ruby](https://github.com/mackuba/bluesky-feeds-rb).
