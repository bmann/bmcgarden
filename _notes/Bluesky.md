> We‘re building the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), a new  foundation for public conversation and social networking which gives creators independence from platforms, developers the freedom to build, and users a choice in their experience.

The company is a Public Benefit Corporation that created the [[ATProtocol]] and built and runs the [Bluesky microblogging platform](https://baky.app).

[[Tim Bray]]  collected [Facts and opinions about Bluesky](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/04/28/Bluesky) because so many people were hating on it, mostly with misinformation.
