I’m running a personal, independent [[Open Collective]] in order to further my interest in [[pooling capital and collaboration]].

I thought about this around the same time as seeing [[Initiative on Sponsorship Forwarding]], where the author Anthony Fu has also [setup a personal collective](https://opencollective.com/antfu).

## Open Collective

I’ve hooked up Stripe to my personal account to accept funds.

Being in Canada, I’ve also setup Interac to send funds directly.
