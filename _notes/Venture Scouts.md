I ran Venture Scouts as a project and mini community for founders and angel investors to support each other. 

The initial concept was that perhaps we could create an early stage fund and equip young people with a diverse background to be scouts in their hyper regional area of Canada: looking for startup founders, equipping them with education, access, referrals and so on, as well as writing extremely small investments: like $10K. But using that as a catalyst to get setup properly, and spur other angels to also write cheques. Effectively acting as a lead. 

This was a model that Boris was successful with at [[Full Stack]], but at the time syndicates werenâ€™t really possible. 

Why? Well, we need to completely reboot and re-invigorate angel investing in Canada, and so we should support the next generation to help with this. 

There was a Discourse forum which I did a bad job of archiving, the static files are at <https://venturescouts.ca>

This name might get revived to apply to [[Founder Peer Investing]].
