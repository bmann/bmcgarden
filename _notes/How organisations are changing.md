- Just over a decade ago, I published the table in figure 1 to describe how organisations were shifting from a traditional form to a set of next generation behaviours. Whilst the table was welcome in some quarters, it was generally met with derision and comments of “this is just for startups”. Not that I’m bitter … much … gronda gronda.
- I’m glad to say that a decade later, that many have already started their journey to the next generation or at least acknowledge it as their future. So, given that I’m a glutton for punishment, I thought I’d repeat the whole process again and see if we can’t find a new “next generation” or in other words, a next “next generation”. Yes, evolution stands still for no-one and whilst cell based organisational structures, open source as a weapon, chaos engines, continuous deployment and learning from ecosystems sounds cutting edge … it was … a decade ago.
