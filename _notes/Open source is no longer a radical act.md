In the early 2000s when I first engaged with open source and joined the [[Drupal]] project, open source, the GPL and other licenses were radical acts. Microsoft was the big enemy and it was a small group of people knowledgeable about [[Open Source Licensing]] against mostly proprietary software. It was a radical act.

In 2024, open source is no longer a radical act.

The [[DWeb]] movement has some of the same seeds of radical acts that open source once add. But also, perhaps [[pooling capital and collaboration]] is radical in the face of corporate owned platforms and capture.

Perhaps another view is that if open source is no longer a radical act, we should get down to the boring but civilization supporting work of treating it like plumbing. Set up funding and maintenance relationships. Make sure maintainers and contributors are compensated.
