- In Building At The Edges, [[Jess Sloss]], instigator at Seed Club, holds intimate conversations with top innovators building irresistible web3 communities. We surface insights from DAO experiments and dig into decentralization's dual challenges and opportunities. Web3 unlocks novel mechanisms for people, not platforms, to capture the value created online. Building At The Edges is where we sense-make the high-velocity design space at the intersection of crypto and community.
