These are some collected resources on how to structure a pitch deck and what content it should contain.

The main goal is to summarize as much of your target market and product / company in a way that helps investors decide whether or not you are "investable".

All "pitches" are conversations -- anything you do on stage, live, is performance, not directly to make an investment decision. So, maybe we should call these "investment decks" rather than "pitch decks".

As explained to me by [Brendan Baker](https://twitter.com/brendanbaker), you're going to meet three types of investors:

1. Those who already obsess over your sector or problem, and are actively looking for companies tackling this area. You will immediately dive deep into discussion and appendix and the future. Use _some_ jargon or insider talk to signal you're on their level.
2. The "average" investor who maybe knows a little about your sector or problem space. You're going to explain the basics of how your customers / product work on what will seem a very basic level to you, but sets up a framework so they can go away feeling they've learned something, and that your later conclusions and insights make sense.
3. The investor who doesn't really invest in your sector / stage / problem space. You failed at pre-qualifying to even be in this meeting. At best, be memorable, educate them about your space, and maybe they'll mention you to someone who is in the other two categories.

If you're on #ehlist, the Pitch Deck Review channel can help you find people who will help review.

> I realized that the best startup pitches seem to fall into several patterns. Depending on the type of business you’re building, who you’re pitching and your personal style, there are probably one or two archetypes that would be most compelling.

>I’ve identified eleven compelling startup pitch archetypes (depending on how you slice it) and have tried to explain what they are, what they sound like, examples of YC companies that might have used this archetype and advice on how you might go about using it.

>There are five core themes followed by a suggested structure:
>
>1. Have a great one-liner
>2. Know your audience
>3. Keep it to 10-15 slides
>4. Beware of the demo
>5. Expect the deck to be shared
>
>And remember: it’s the story and the conversation that is important – not the imagery and colors. If you can convey the passion that drives you (and your users / customers!), you will have created a powerful pitch deck.
