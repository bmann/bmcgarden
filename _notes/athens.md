- > We are creating and will create vast amounts of value, and we should capture value proportionally. Being open-source shouldn't change that. In fact, arguably we should be capturing MORE value, not in spite of, but BECAUSE we're open-source.
- > I'm going to take a page out of Roam's book (once again) and price our sponsorships at $16/month (Athenian) and $501 / 5 years (Believer), because that's how much I pay for Roam, and I believe Athens will create at least as much value as Roam _if the only difference_ were that we were open-source.
