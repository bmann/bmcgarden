The [CoSocial Community Co-operative](https://blog.cosocial.ca) is a member-owned co-op dedicated to open social media that is Canadian owned.

The main service is a [[Mastodon]] server at <https://cosocial.ca>. There is a [[Discourse]] forum for members that also has a public wiki <https://members.cosocial.ca>.

I'm a board member, and help out with technical operations.
