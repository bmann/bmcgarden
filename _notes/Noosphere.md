> **The Noosphere Protocol** is part of an effort to bootstrap a new kind of content web. Noosphere, like its namesake, is a worldwide medium for thinking together.

The open source back end protocol powering the [[Subconscious]] app. The [Subconscious Noosphere Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/wyHPzGraBh) is one of my favourite place for learning and discussion. 

> Noosphere draws from the same foundational ideas as [[IPFS]], [[ActivityPub]], [[ATProtocol]], [[Nostr]] and other protocols. But, it distinguishes itself in meaningful ways:
> 
> * Users truly own and control their data, even when infrastructure providers become adversaries
> * All operations are local-first and work offline
> * Infrastructure providers trust users, not the other way around
> * There is no blockchain, central authority or other built-in, global source of truth
