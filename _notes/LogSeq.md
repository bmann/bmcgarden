Highly granular graph based note taking tool. It's an outliner, and every outline item is a separate block that can be referenced and transcluded.

I have used it for a version of this site and published it at <https://notes.bmannconsulting.com>. I'm slowly converting it back here, because it didn't work well for publishing. I still use it for private note taking.

The Live Demo can in fact be used permanently https://demo.logseq.com/ -- uses the [File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access)[^chrome]

[^chrome]: I started going down the rabbit hole on how much of a Chromium only API this is. Safari _may_ have partial support in the very newest operating systems on iOS / MacOS. And of course, you have to accomplish cross-device sync in some other way, as it reads/writes on your local file system only.
