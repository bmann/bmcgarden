Open source [[Product Analytics]]

From their [Github](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog): "We are an open source alternative to [[Mixpanel]], [[Amplitude]] or [[Heap]], designed to be more developer friendly."

They have a [[Deploy To Heroku]] they recommend as the easiest way to [[selfhosted]].

They consider themselves [[OpenCore]]: the core product is [[MIT License]], but they have proprietary extensions and a proprietary enterprise license for a certain directory. They also maintain a [mirror of just MIT code at posthog/posthog-foss](https://github.com/posthog/posthog-foss).
