> As explained in [The Rise of Startup Studios](https://www.gssn.co/media), a white paper published by The Global Startup Studio Network in 2019, the term “startup studio” covers a wide range of actors and operating principles.
To be considered a startup studio, we set an arbitrary threshold of a minimum of _6 months of highly active assistance_ to each startup. Anything below the threshold can be broadly covered by the term “accelerator”.

via @allbombs, from the [[eFounders]] blog: [Sidecar funds, corporate vehicles, club deals: how do startup studios get financed?](https://blog.efounders.co/sidecar-funds-corporate-vehicles-club-deals-how-do-startup-studios-get-financed-c6763c826ac0).

> The 2 core differentiation criteria between different types of startup studios are:
> * Are the ideas born **“internally”** and subsequently pitched to entrepreneurs who’ll join the venture or does the studio consider **“external”** ideas by partnering with or finding inspiration from an existing team of entrepreneurs with their own idea.
> * Are the created ventures "**independent** by default” from the studio or are the ventures dependent of the studio’s operational resources, aka the **“integrated model”**.

This gives us 4 quadrants:

Integrated
* Internal Ideas, aka **Platform Builders**. Examples: [[Enhance Ventures]], [[Polymath Ventures]]
* External Ideas, aka **Execution Engines**. Examples: [[Rocket Internet]]

Independent
* Internal Ideas, aka **Crazy Creatives**. Examples: [[eFounders]], [[High Alpha]], [[PSL]]
* External Ideas, aka **Service Experts**. Examples: [[Coplex]], [[Prehype]]
