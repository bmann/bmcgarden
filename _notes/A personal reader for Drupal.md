— > I’m happy to announce that the [personal reader](https://www.drupal.org/project/reader) project I’ve been writing for Drupal is now available for download! You can install it on your website, and as a PWA on your phone or tablet. No more third party applications, just pure HTML, css and the power of Drupal. The layout is heavily influenced by the Mastodon project, but needs more tweaks to fix the responsive behavior.

- Check out the post for a screencast of functionality.

- A great example of using Drupal to power a bunch of decentralized protocols including [[ActivityPub]] and [[MicroSub]]. The module in turn also relies on the [IndieWeb module for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb).
