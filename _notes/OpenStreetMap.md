> [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/)Â is a free, editable map of the whole world made by people like you. It was started in 2004 in the UK, out of frustration with the lack of availability of good map data that was free to use.

Run by the [OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/osm-foundation/):
> OpenStreetMap is not a closely governed or managed project; grassroots activities are the core of the movement, and individuals participating in OpenStreetMap enjoy great freedom. The OpenStreetMap Foundation is the nonprofit organization that supports OpenStreetMap and provides the necessary organizational backbone. It is made up of a number of different members and groups.
