> After many years working towards paradigmatic change on the web at Mozilla and Protocol Labs, WebTransitions was formed by [[Dietrich Ayala]] as a not-for-profit organization (pending) to enable experimentation and innovation on the web platform. It is a connector between those who want to see change on the web, and those who can help make it happen - or at least help to learn whether it should or could happen at all.

Currently working with these fine folks, among others:

- [[Protocol Labs]]
- [[Igalia]]
- [[Little Bear Labs]]
- [[IPFS Shipyard]]
- [[Open Impact Foundation]]
- [[Brave]]
- [[Peergos]]

And directly with browser vendors and engines such as Chrome/Chromium, Firefox/Gecko, Safari/Webkit, Microsoft Edge, Opera and more.
