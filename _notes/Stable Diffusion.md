- [What was the Stable Diffusion model trained on?](https://stability.ai/faq)
	- The underlying dataset for Stable Diffusion was the 2b English language label subset of [[Laion]] 5b https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/, ==a general crawl of the internet created by the German charity LAION==. The CompVis team at the University of Heidelberg trained the model in compliance with German law. The underlying dataset was not filtered to exclude or include any specific group.
