> Open Collective is a **legal and financial**toolbox for grassroots groups. It’s a **fundraising + legal status + money management** platform for your community.

Website: <https://opencollective.com>

I’ve followed and used this platform for years and I highly recommend it for projects and collectives of all sorts. 

[[Fission]] is a Fiscal Host, meaning we provide the backend for multiple collectives. 

In Canada, [[Hypha Co-op]] is another. 

> **Collaborate with money**
> A shared account to fundraise and manage money, connect with your people, and more.

Very much in line with my [[pooling capital and collaboration]]

The organization is going through an [[Exit to Community]] process: <https://opencollective.com/e2c>
