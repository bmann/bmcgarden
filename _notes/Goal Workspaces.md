A space where a group of human and software agents collaborate on a shared goal. 

Today, with human only participants, this could be any shared collaborative software.

As AI-based [[agentic computing]] evolves, these goal workspaces share data, feedback, interfaces, visualizations, and outputs that lead towards some goal. 

A related term to goal would be intent.
