Copyleft license that requires source code changes to hosted software also to be made available.

> The new license was named the GNU Affero General Public License. Retaining the Affero name indicated its close historic relationship with AGPLv1. The GNU AGPL was given version number 3 for parity with the GPL, and the current GNU Affero General Public License is often abbreviated _AGPLv3_.
> 
> The finalized version of GNU AGPLv3 was published by the FSF on November 19, 2007.
