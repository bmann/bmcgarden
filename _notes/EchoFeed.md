A [[crossposting]] SaaS app that takes RSS as input and can be configured to post to many different services. 

> It supports reading RSS and Atom and JSON feeds and then posting those items to Mastodon and Micro.blog and Bluesky and GitHub and Discord and LinkAce. Or it can send them as Webmentions and Webhooks.

## Pricing

Freemium version that fetches every 15 minutes, or $25/year for fetching every 2 minutes. 

## Fedica Alternative 

I use [[Fedica]] for this, which also supports Twitter and LinkedIn. 

As well, the key feature for me is that Fedica lets me setup a posting schedule that trickles out posts slowly over time.
