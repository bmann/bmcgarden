- Run by [[Jacob Sayles]] and [[Katie Davis]]
- Cascadia Collaborative Design is a design, technology and business consulting firm dedicated to supporting collaborative communities – coworking, coliving, artists and maker spaces – with the tools they need to be healthy and successful.
- > Our areas of expertise bring design, technology and business operations services together to leverage the power of community. As our society values technology and independence from traditional institutions, our chosen communities become our new homes, our new support systems, our new networks. At Cascadia Collaborative Design, we help these communities thrive to support collaboration, combat loneliness and build stronger economies and collectives.
