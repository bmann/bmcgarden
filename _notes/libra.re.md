[[Boris Anthony]]’s web ebook project. 

> Ebooks, as they have been made available to us, do not afford the attendant contextual experiences that books in the physical world do. Sadly, they seem to only address the most basic technical—and mercantile—experience of books: read it once, then find another to buy.
> 
> I built this web-based platform to explore how we might recapture some of those missing experiences… and what novel ones may be made possible with digital technologies.

> It turns out that actually living with ebooks, especially in any social way, comes very close to contravening digital copyright legislation.
