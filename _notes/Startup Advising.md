## Courting Advisors, a guide for founders
I wrote this article initially [for Startup North](http://www.startupnorth.ca/2013/06/25/courting-advisors-a-guide-for-founders/) in 2013 and then later cross-posted it to the [[Full Stack]] [Medium blog](https://medium.com/full-stack/courting-advisors-a-canadian-founder-s-guide-53fb855c3a67) in 2015.

## BC Advisory Agreement
The advisory agreement is written in the context of a company in the Province of BC.

It is available in the [Full Stack Github repo](https://github.com/FullStackFoundry/common-seed-termsheets/blob/master/bc-advisory-agreement.md).

TODO: talk to [[Ascent Foundry]] about getting an updated template made available.
