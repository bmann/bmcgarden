Feel free to tweet or DM me [[@bmann::http://twitter.com/bmann]] or on [[Social.Coop]] Mastodon [@bmann@social.coop](https://social.coop/@bmann).

You can usually find me in the [[Fission]] Discord Chat https://fission.codes/discord, which also happens to be a fun place to hang out if you like technical, open source, and general developer topics.

For [[Startup]] topics, advice, and support, I'm in the [[EhList]] Canadian founders Slack. I'll also bug you to join the [[Venture Scouts]] forum.

If we've met in person, happy to [[connect on LinkedIn::http://www.linkedin.com/in/boris]]. Write something interesting in your connect message if we haven't met :)

Happy to do an intro call (or coffee if you're local to Vancouver): [Book a time on my calendar Â»](https://calendly.com/borismann/meeting)
