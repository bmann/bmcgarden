## Payroll

I've used Wave for years for payroll, including lots of startups. It's very easy and straightforward for smaller teams.

## Pricing

Starts at free, and you can easily create multiple organizations. Supports [[Sole Proprietorship]]

Does direct deposit into employee or contractor accounts.

$20/month pro plan includes connecting to bank account and downloading transactions and a few other things.

Payroll has [separate pricing](https://support.waveapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000494603-How-much-does-Wave-Payroll-cost#h_01GKHX0H0QRDTJXX9S33MXQK07), ~$25/month base fee, then $6/employee or contractor.
