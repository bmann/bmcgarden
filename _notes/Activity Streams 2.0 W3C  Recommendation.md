- ## Abstract
	- This specification details a model for representing potential and completed activities using the JSON format. It is intended to be used with vocabularies that detail the structure of activities, and define specific types of activities.
- ## Author's Note
- *This section is non-normative.*
- This draft is heavily influenced by the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 specification originally co-authored by Martin Atkins, Will Norris, Chris Messina, Monica Wilkinson, Rob Dolin and James Snell. The author is very thankful for their significant contributions and gladly stands on their shoulders. Some portions of the original text of Activity Streams 1.0 are used in this document.
