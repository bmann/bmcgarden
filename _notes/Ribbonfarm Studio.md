- This newsletter is where I develop my longer, more complex projects. The newsletter features a mix of one-off pieces and serialized content from the larger projects. Currently, I am developing three such larger projects:
- [The Great Weirding](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/the-great-weirding/), an essay collection about the global transformation that occurred 2016-20
- [The Clockless Clock](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/the-clockless-clock/), a book about the changing nature of time in the digital era
- [After Westphalia](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/after-westphalia/), a set of essays about the shape of the post-nation-state world.
