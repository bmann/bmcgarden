I kind of hate this [Fast Company review of the 2024 MacBook Air called “Dawn of the AI laptop”](https://www.fastcompany.com/91049319/2024-macbook-air-review) — but it’s the label that’s selling laptops today. Without “touchscreen capability, fancy rotating hinges, folding screens, or other features” that PC manufacturers are attempting.
