[OWA on Apple killing web apps in the EU](https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/)

This feels … complicated. There are new browser engines allowed in the EU.

Any of the new browsers — including Chrome or Firefox — could be a great host for PWAs on iOS now, decoupled from Safari versions.
