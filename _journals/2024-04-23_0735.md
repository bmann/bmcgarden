Long thread by [@maegul@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@maegul/112319245679533802) on if posting [[Ghost]] and Wordpress blogs into ActivityPub microblogging makes sense from a UX perspective. 

If I were Ghost, I’d add a default “Ghost account”, as well as enable per site AP server — active sites would be more like Reddits.

The Notes vs Article [[Activity Vocabulary]] types and how they look like in different clients has barely been touched.
