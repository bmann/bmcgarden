Following on [[Paying people to work on open source is good actually]], Chad Whitacre proposes [[Software Commons]] as the big tent definition of open source in his post [[Towards Software Commons]].

From the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_commons&oldid=1186082015#Software_commons):

> The _software commons_ consists of all computer software which is available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few restrictions. It includes open source software which can be modified with few restrictions. However the commons also includes software outside of these categories

I like it!
