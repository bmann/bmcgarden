[20 years of Flickr](https://blog.flickr.net/en/2024/02/02/20-years-of-significant-moments-in-flickrs-development/). And I just happened to tell the story today of the tech meetup I organized in Vancouver 20 years ago. 6 people came, including [Roland Tanglao](http://rolandtanglao.com/), who got us all early access to Flickr.

I still have the [blog post from the Vancouver Geek Dinner](https://bmannconsulting.com/archive/2004/02/11/vancouver-geek-dinner-wrap-up/). And some notes on that [early full screen Flash-powered version of Flickr](https://bmannconsulting.com/archive/2004/02/16/flickr-kicks-off-rich-media-arms-race-for-social-networking-apps/). And some sort of [Flickr Buddy Icons](https://bmannconsulting.com/archive/2004/03/09/flickr-buddy-icons-fun/) that _still works 20 years later_.
