OK, one more quick hack to the Journal feed.

Relative paths for images are a problem. Maybe they actually aren't for many modern feed readers. But they ARE if I want Micro.blog to crosspost correctly.

[Found this hack to use the Liquid `replace` filter](https://bdunagan.com/2021/10/29/jekyll-tip-absolute-urls-for-links-and-images-in-rss-feed/) to look for src tags and then add in the full path to your site.

I'll test it tomorrow by posting an image. Time for bed!
