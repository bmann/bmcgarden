Chad works with me at [[Fission]]. I’ve been thinking about this a lot in all areas of my life, from work, to community, to family, to individual. 

For me personally, I need to have high alignment between what I’m interested in and what I do for work. So I’ve often created my own work to ensure that alignment.

The downside of blurring of lines between stuff that is being done for work, and stuff to tinker with for personal enjoyment.
