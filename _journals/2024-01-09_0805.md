> I'd like to see web hosting look much more like installing an app on an iPhone.

This is at the end of [Ben Werdmuller’s response](https://werd.io/2024/make-the-indie-web-easier) to Giles Turnbull’s [Let’s make the IndieWeb easier](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html).

I couldn’t agree more. This is part of the deep dive I’ve been doing on [[Cloudron]] and similar [[Bring Your Own Server]] management systems. 

More generally, I’ve been concerned with the practices of open source software builders. There is very little [[Design for Deployment]] that makes it easier for less technical users to self host. 

I think open app stack packaging formats like [[Buildpacks]] is a good direction.
