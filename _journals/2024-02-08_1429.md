I have a [[Twitter]] archive powered by Tweetback. There are apparently [68 Tweetback Canonical](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/notes/2024/02/08/2/) archives registered, which will link to the “canonical” URLs of each others archives. 

I think Mastodon or Bluesky import is a more likely path for people who really want their archive online.

Bluesky, which will support running your own [[PDS]], seems like a good architecture for this.
