I came across [a thread by @vkc](https://mspsocial.net/@vkc/111766525303910449) about doing an experiment of not using big search engines.

She in turn linked to Neil’s blog [A week of not using a search engine](https://neilzone.co.uk/2024/01/a-week-of-not-using-a-search-engine/).

There’s a general rebirth of curated directory sites, and I’m personally interested in community or commons search. I’d much rather get a search result that is in essence a recommendation or at least experience of someone I know.
