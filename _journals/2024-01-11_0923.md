Just saw that [Meetup was acquired by Bending Spoons](https://www.meetup.com/blog/a-new-home-for-meetup/). This is the same company that acquired Evernote.

For me, Meetup is the epitome of platform capture. I won't use it for anything I organize. [[Luma]] is what I use, but just for RSVP / attendance, and I can export email as needed.
