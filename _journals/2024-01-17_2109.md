New Public made a directory of “digital social platforms”:

> The Directory is a list of spaces that have taken at least some notable steps to build a public-spirited user experience, embody at least one of New_Public’s [Civic Signals](https://newpublic.org/interactive), and/or implement creative new design patterns.

I love the words on the [directory landing page](https://newpublic.org/directory). Seriously, go read the intro, it’s great.

I am annoyed that the [directory listing](https://airtable.com/appgA6QrWMpXmDp9X/shr7JFPTJt1C9j0qA/tblwlRhU0Icd8p5iJ) is a bare listing of Airtable records. 

The [Landscape maps made in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hIXr7RpUBaCo1IOcUjn5uv/Digital-Social-Spaces%3A-Landscape-Mapping?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=xiapreoUzezlLN80-0) are much more engaging.
