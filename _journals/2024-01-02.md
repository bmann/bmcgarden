I set up [[Working Copy]] so I can use [[Obsidian]] on my phone with git syncing / publishing. I always forget the order of steps.

1. Make Obsidian vault on mobile
2. In Working Copy, clone the git repo
3. Looking at the repo in Working Copy, click on Repository / Status and Configuration
4. Click on the disclosure arrow for the repo title, select _Link Repository to_ and select _Directory_

This "day" should have two other entries, with `YYYYMMDDHHmm` titles.
