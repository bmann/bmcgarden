At [[Z Space]] for an afternoon of tinkering. I should be doing some more [[LOCALHOST]] setup and writing, but ended up working with the [[MiniPC PL63]] here.

The [[Razor Core X Chroma]] stopped connecting, so I'm troubleshooting. 

Along the way, I installed [[Obsidian]] so I could type these notes, and [[Github Desktop]] so I could sync the notes.

So, the Razor eGPU really should be plug and play (and was before). There are some drivers for MacOS (which is what I originally used it with, but it only supports Intel Macs), but really nothing for Windows.

I am going to attempt to install ASUS updated drivers. There is a Management Engine Interface (MEI) and Chipset update that could work.

Hmmm. Updated Thunderbolt drivers?

Try another reboot...
