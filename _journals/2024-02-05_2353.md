[“Wherever you get your podcasts” is a radical statement, Anil Dash](https://anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/):

> “being able to say, "wherever you get your podcasts" is a _radical statement_. Because what it represents is the triumph of exactly the kind of technology that's supposed to be impossible: open, empowering tech that's not owned by any one company, that _can't_ be controlled by any one company, and that allows people to have ownership over their work and their relationship with their audience.”

I’m looking for more radical statements.
