I got an email from [[Daylight Computer]] today telling me Iâ€™m getting a partial refund now that they have retail pricing announced on their e-ink tablet.

Oh right! I bought into their founders round way back in 2022 and [wrote a post about how they might run their developer ecosystem](https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/2022/06/01/kickstarting-app-ecosystem/). Exciting!
