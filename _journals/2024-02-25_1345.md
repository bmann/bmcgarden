I think the word bridge is now at the level of trigger word for people.

What if I call [[Misskey]] a bridge to [[Mastodon]]? 

It means something socially and technically to some group of people which is disconnected from how it works. 

Networked communications are absolutely social discussions — not just tech. 

But if you disregard how the tech actually works, you’re not going to get very far with social discussions either.
