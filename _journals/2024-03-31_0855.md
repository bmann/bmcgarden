Glyph writes [Software Needs To Be More Expensive](https://blog.glyph.im/2024/03/software-needs-to-be-more-expensive.html), mostly suggesting that low barrier “let engineers expense $50 per month to any open source project” could help.

It can fit alongside current real world movements to “buy local”.
