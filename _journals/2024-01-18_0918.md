From [Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-synchronous-tools), “Matrix is the #1 chat tool by current users' satisfaction”

This is of course a popularity contest, but it’s still useful.

Matches my expectations, eg lots of awareness of Microsoft Teams, people that use it hate it. Discord is desired and loved.

As you go down the list, it’s mostly that people haven’t heard of these tools. Zulip is an outlier — those people I know who use it really love it, and that shows up here. 

This section is called “Synchronous tools” and this was the prompt:

> Which **communication tools** did you use regularly over the past year, and which do you want to work with over the next year? Select all that apply

Ok, I guess I’ll need to go dig into the [Asynchronous tools](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-asynchronous-tools) next. Everything is asynchronous when you’re a multi time zone community or organization.
