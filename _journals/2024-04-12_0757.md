[Ivo Velitchkov @kvistgaard](https://x.com/kvistgaard/status/1778789885911962026) talks about what heâ€™s missing from the [[reMarkable]]:

> 1. Export of highlights from PDF and EPUB
> 2. Links between notes and related to that:
> 3. Persistent IDs of every object (note, notebook, folder, tag) so that they can be referred to from other places and opened up in the desktop or mobile app.

Strong agree!
