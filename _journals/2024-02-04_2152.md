Craig Mod writes ["Oh God, It's Raining Newsletters"](https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/) (2019), which is a delightful piece of writing with many links that you should read in full, but I will quote a few snippets:

> "I fear we’re entering an era of newsletter fatigue…"
> "the state of newsletters and email, in 2019: Things are unexpectedly amazing"
> "there’s something about the _framing_ of email — the inbox, that weird neither-here-nor-there networked space"
> "These newsletters are the most backed up pieces of writing in history, copies in millions of inboxes, on millions of hard drives and servers, far more than any blog post."
> "They’re everywhere but privately so, hidden, piggybacking on the most accessible, oldest networked publishing platform in the world."
