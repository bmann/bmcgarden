I'm totally energized from talking to [Jesse Sugarman of Osito](https://www.osito.ca/). Osito hosted [[Minimum Viable Demos]] and we'll be having the [LOCALHOST Thursday social](https://lu.ma/b9p075ag) there.

I toured Jesse around [[Z-Space]] and we talked about the art / tech / music scene locally, and how we can support it and work together. Good vibes!
