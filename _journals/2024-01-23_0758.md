Capturing a link to [Obsidian Map View Plugin](https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-map-view), since it came up in discussion. Open source, uses [[OpenStreetMap]] and open map tiles for search and display.

My exploration on [[Boris Map]] is mostly for [[FoodWiki]] purposes. I use basic tagging for notes pages if I want to capture e.g. that a person entry is in _Vancouver_.
