Great read about the [recent Mastodon CVE](https://arcanican.is/excerpts/cve-2024-23832/discovery.htm) (which could allow taking over and forging content for remote accounts). 

I’m quoting a bit here about open source:

> how people seem to only care for the 'gratis' of free software, and seldom the 'libre', and millions of users leaning on the work of primarily a couple developers, assuming they have the attentiveness to catch every mistake themselves alone

There aren’t enough funded people - both teams and individuals - working on Fediverse software, and both the users and the admins seem averse to paying for it.
