[Manton from Micro.blog](https://www.manton.org/2024/02/23/bluesky-opening-up.html) intends to enable the service as an [[ATProtocol]]  PDS:

> The long-term plan for Micro.blog is to fully support AT’s PDS — Personal Data Servers. Any blog hosted on Micro.blog would plug into Bluesky seamlessly, with data portable to other AT Protocol hosting providers.

[[Micro.blog]] already functions as an ActivityPub server, and currently supports cross-posting to Bluesky.
