The [[IxDA]] non-profit is shutting down, seen via [@jarango](https://x.com/jarango/status/1801744205792088491) who comments: "how do we build a community of practice in a world where in-person conferences are no longer a viable means for funding community orgs?"

I have many thoughts on this, and we'll be exploring this for [[Causal Islands]].
