[[Steven Sinofsky]] writes about Apple and the DMA in [“Building Under Regulation”](https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/215-building-under-regulation):

> As I read the over 60 pages of the DMA when it was passed…my heart sank over the complexity of a regulation so poorly constructed yet so clearly aimed at specific (American) companies and products.

It’s a long post and Sinofsky has a lot of relevant personal experience here. I’ll likely clip the article and look for some more quotes and take aways.
