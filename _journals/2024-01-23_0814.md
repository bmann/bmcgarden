The [Perplexity AI summary of 'what is OpenStreetMap?'](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-is-OpenStreetMap-2pVFODzPR8OVT0OC6sZc7A?s=u) is pretty good. Cites sources and summarizes and synthesizes. I didn't add this to my notes entry for [[OpenStreetMap]] directly, but did link the source web pages and quote text from the sources.
