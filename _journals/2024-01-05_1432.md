TLDraw has changed its license to non-commercial. The founder Steve Ruizok dropped a note in the [Cloudron forums](https://forum.cloudron.io/topic/10800/license-change/3) saying that Cloudron may not be in compliance. I left a comment, as there are a number of apps with different licenses, and e.g. me running TLDraw on [[Commons Computer]] is not running it commercially.
