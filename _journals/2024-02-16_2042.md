The [Polkadot ecosystem has defined salaries and grades for fellowships](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0050-fellowship-salaries.md). Via Dietrich, who put together [background context on Parity/Polkadot decentralization](https://hackmd.io/pZC0PF_mRfmJdM4sHMoz5g).

Fits my [[open source as a job]] thinking, and is roughly what I suggested when I was working in the Ethereum core ecosystem: $10KUSD per month is a decent engineer salary.
