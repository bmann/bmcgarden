The [[Subconscious]] team is announcing that they're [shutting down](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subconscious-is-winding-down). The very short version from [[Gordon Brander]] "Today, if you want to amplify intelligence, you probably wouldnâ€™t build a decentralized notes graph, you would go to work on personal AI."

Having just gone through this with Fission, I feel for Gordon and cdata and the whole team. Thank you for striving, for your writings, and for the wonderful community you built in your Discord.
