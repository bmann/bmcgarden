I had an amazing catch up with Ami last week. He’s the founder of [[Creative Pulse]], a community running in Vancouver for 10 years.

The [next event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/knowledge-sharing-why-smart-creatives-build-in-public-tickets-901446128637) is about type designer Alanna Munro’s approach to [[Build in Public]] .
