[Tom Critchlow writes up notes on his Remarkable Tablet](https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/02/09/remarkable-notes/). I have a [[reMarkable]] tablet myself and think Tom’s suggestions are pretty great. 

> I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad

Notes, daily entry, and sync as core primitives are very powerful. 

I pre-ordered a stealth tablet a couple of years back and then wrote a post about [[2022-06-01-kickstarting-app-ecosystem|Kickstarting an app ecosystem]] which suggested similar things. 

Apparently reMarkable is only getting more tied to mandatory, single source subscription services, which is not a great way to build an ecosystem around a device.
