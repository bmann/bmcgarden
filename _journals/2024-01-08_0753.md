[Andy Wingo, Missing the point of WebAssembly](https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/01/08/missing-the-point-of-webassembly) and offers his own starting point:

> _WebAssembly is a new fundamental abstraction boundary_. WebAssembly is a new way of dividing computing systems into pieces and of composing systems from parts.
