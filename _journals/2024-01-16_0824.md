[The Future is not Docker](https://blog.kylegalbraith.com/the-future-is-not-docker/)

> The future is not Docker, but containers are.

> We started building [Depot](https://depot.dev/) back in January 2022 to solve our own pain of living with slow Docker image builds in generic CI providers like GitHub Actions, Circle, etc. We were annoyed by having to save/load layer cache over slow networks, the lack of larger managed runners, and having to rely on slow emulation for multi-platform or Arm image builds.
