Three quotes from [“The Internets Meaning Crisis”, by Kneeling Bus](https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/the-internets-meaning-crisis):

> The average human living today sees more things they don’t care about in one week than a medieval peasant did in their entire lifetime.

Parasocial media as antidote to AI content:

> As AI normalizes the idea of human-free content creation, parasocial media merits appreciation: We gravitate toward work that foregrounds its creator because that person is often the ultimate reason we’re interested in the work, directly or indirectly

Increasingly baroque personal info filter systems:

> It’s increasingly urgent to develop an effective personal system for keeping the digital entropy at bay, even if it’s as simple as “haphazardly ignore most of what comes through.”
