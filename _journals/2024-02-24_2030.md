Steve Klabnik writes up his own take on [How does Bluesky work](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/how-does-bluesky-work)

> I think the separation of concerns between atproto and BlueSky are very meaningful, as having a “killer app” for the network gives a reason to use it. It also is a form of dogfooding, making sure that atproto is good enough to be able to build real applications on.
