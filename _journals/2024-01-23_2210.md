[Aaron Boodman @aboodman has a thread on fenced communities](https://x.com/aboodman/status/1749911394647232728) which I very much agree with and replied to him with a link.

Fenced community is my own term, from [[Open Source Licensing]]: restrict access to the scarce resources aka Common Goods of support, maintenance, discussion etc, but keep the code open.
