Added the journal feed in the link header of all pages so it can be auto-discovered.

Pleasantly surprised to be digging into the [[IPFS]] `_redirects` [spec](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0002/). I guess I can just point to my old archive! `/archive/* https://2023.bmannconsulting.com/archive/* 301`

Made a [[BMC]] page where some TO DO stuff will live.

How many times have I ended up using this [Jekyll JSON Feed Template](https://github.com/georgemandis/jekyll-json-feeds)? Many times! The special treatment for link front matter has me thinking.

Decided to not mess with feed format right now. It's working, let's use it for a bit, and see how various things look once they cross-post through Micro.blog to Mastodon. Where it's actually putting content on my under-used [@boris@toolsforthought.social](https://toolsforthought.social/@boris) account.

Added a Journal layout template.
* Removed LogSeq note site links
* Added tag display from blog posts layout, which links to `/notes/tag` (but can't tell if it exists or not, so might 404)
* Added [[via]] link to the sidebar
* Used Link as the title if it exists

And I guess this will be a test of what large journal cross-posts do!

### Update

Got Redirects working correctly! So https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/2021/02/13/drop-in-audio/ should redirect to https://2023.bmannconsulting.com/blog/2021/02/13/drop-in-audio/ (same theme, so won't even look that different).

And cross posting of large posts works just fine, with a link back to the post. Nice!
