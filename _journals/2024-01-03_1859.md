Ok, final post of the day now that I’ve learned about [[Obsidian]] nuances with Daily notes vs Unique note creator. 

I do want to open up a Daily note when I open. But, I want to just use the same format as the Unique note creator so all the files have the same format. 

So, the first note of the day will always have the title for the day — eg January 3rd, 2024. But the same file naming format as Unique notes.

The Liquid template for the Journal page then loops through and groups all the posts by day, so you can read them all together, but with permalinks for each one.
