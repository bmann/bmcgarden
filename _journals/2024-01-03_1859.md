Ok, final post of the day now that Iâ€™ve learned about [[Obsidian]] nuances with Daily notes vs Unique note creator. 

I do want to open up a Daily note when I open. But, I want to just use the same format as the Unique note creator so all the files have the same format. 

As it turns out, because I made unique page names with a timestamp, the daily journal button effectively becomes a new unique note creator!

The Liquid template for the Journal page then loops through and groups all the posts by day, so you can read them all together, but with permalinks for each one. You can see it in action on the [Journal page](https://bmannconsulting.com/journal).

I think it looks pretty good! Maybe even interesting enough to put on the home page?
