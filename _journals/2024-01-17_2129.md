[What's IPFS and how it compares to BitTorrent](https://norman.life/posts/ipfs-bittorrent) is an article by Daniel Norman correcting and explaining many of the details about IPFS as a response to [a blog comparing the two](https://liamz.co/tech-blog/2023/08/10/comparing-ipfs-and-bittorrent.html). 

Itâ€™s really well written. I should quote pieces of it on my [[IPFS]] notes page.
