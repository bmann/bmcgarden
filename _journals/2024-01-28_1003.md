This article [“The Negative Impact of Mobile-First Web Design on Desktop”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-dispersion/) feels like the reverse of what we would have seen 10 years ago, complaining about designs that don’t work on mobile.

The article states that 55% of web traffic comes from mobile. I bet if we measured “human time spent reading content” that mobile would be even higher. 

This fits into my [[death of the professional desktop operating system]] theme.  I think we should consider desktop design to be a luxury, for art and experiences.
