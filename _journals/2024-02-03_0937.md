Right now, I pay for two open social protocols. For [[ActivityPub]], I pay for my own servers (hosting) and clients (Ivory). For [[Farcaster]], I pay for invites and channels.

[[ATProtocol]], I need [[Bluesky]] to get off your butts and launch federation to enable various people to start charging for things.
