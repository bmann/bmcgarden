[Matthew Ingram writes a post mortem on The Messenger news startup](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/shoot-the-messenger.php):

> The saddest part of this whole saga, [as Simon Owens noted](https://www.threads.net/@simondowens/post/C2x65yOOBfb), is that the $50 million Finkelstein and his team chewed through could have funded a hundred local news startups that people might actually want or need.

I’m a big fan of the “fund a bunch of smaller attempts”. Knowing when to favour that vs fund the larger impactful thing is hard.
