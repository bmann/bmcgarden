[[Ente]] just [announced open sourcing their full backend](https://ente.io/blog/open-sourcing-our-server/).

It’s an end-to-end encrypted “alternative to Google or Apple photos”, licensed as [[AGPL]].

Their client code had always been open source, this completes making the entire service available.
