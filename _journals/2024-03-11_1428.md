I took some downtime this weekend and played many hours of [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/), an RPG / roguelike that has a vast world and many commands and abilities.

Found myself searching a lot of basics, like "How do I fill a waterskin with liquid?", and deciding how many arms and legs I wanted my mutant character to have.
