[Gitlab has a backlog item for enabling ActivityPub support](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11247). There isn't a lot of consistency in this stuff yet, don't know if they'll confirm to what [[ForgeFed]] is designing, or just aim for "can subscribe in Mastodon" (really, they should be supporting both).
