[Chris Paik @cpaik](https://x.com/cpaik/status/1796633683908005988?m) wrote a short piece predicting [The End of Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103cGe8qixC7ZzFsRu5Ww2VEW5YgH9zQaiaqbBsZ1lcc/mobilebasic). The premise is that software will go the way of journalism, because of LLMs making it.

Here are three quotes:

“Software is expensive because developers are expensive.”

“Vogue wasn’t replaced by another fashion media company, it was replaced by 10,000 influencers.”

“Majoring in computer science today will be like majoring in journalism in the late 90’s.”

I’m someone who would like to see more user malleable software, but we’re not quite there yet.
