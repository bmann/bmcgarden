This FOSDEM talk on [Domain: a modular Rust DNS toolkit](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2853-domain-a-modular-rust-dns-toolkit/) looks interesting:

> The "domain" crate is a Rust library that aims to provide a wide range of building blocks that are necessary or useful when building specialised DNS applications.
> 
> In this talk we will look at the history, current state, and future of the crate and how it differs from other offerings in the Rust ecosystem. We will explore how the crate aims to leverage Rustâ€™s type system to make it easier to model the complexities of the DNS in a straightforward way that helps make it easier to build correct and efficient applications.
