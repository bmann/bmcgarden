Apple released a game porting toolkit that has been improved by [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/):

> app that wraps both Wine, the tool that translates Windows API calls to their Unix-like equivalents, and Appleâ€™s game porting toolkit into one very friendly interface. That removes pretty much all of the work out of the process, to the point where all I had to do was download Whisky and drag it into my Applications folder.

[Dan Moren writes at Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/to-embrace-gaming-apple-needs-to-level-up-its-game-porting-toolkit/) that maybe Apple should make running PC games on MacOS great with this method.
