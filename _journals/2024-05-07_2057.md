[@mathewchaim](https://x.com/matthewchaim/status/1787986160507130361) on how we get to keep building the Internet. This really resonated with me:

> we’ve been given the opportunity to keep building the internet
> 
> it’s not so much about building a new internet 
> 
> it’s more that we get to keep on building the internet
> 
> because the internet essentially stopped being built
> 
> we arrived at a specific junction, put down our tools, and turned ads on to monetize what had been built
> 
> here we find ourselves in green pastures
> 
> where we can pick the tools back up
> 
> and keep on building this thing out
