I’ve been reading lots of [[Apple Vision Pro]] reviews and chatter.

I spent several years working in AR/VR/XR and tinkered with hand input + interfaces. We _knew_ that mobile OS powered headset was coming from Apple.

Then I watched Apple evolve their UI on Mac and iOS for years, that pointed without a doubt to not being bounded by a screen.

I’ll get one when they’re available in Canada. Or, uh, maybe on my next trip to the US 😅
