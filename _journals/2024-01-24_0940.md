Brought to my attention by [@django@cosocial.ca's post](https://cosocial.ca/@Django/111811943859262877) linking to [Michael Geist's article on Bill S-210](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2024/01/site-blocking-and-age-verification-for-twitter-instagram-snap-and-twitch-age-verification-lobby-confirms-it-wants-bill-s-210-to-cover-all-social-media-sites/), and that it may apply to the fediverse as well:

> the unlimited scope of the Canadian law to sites such as Twitter, Snap, Instagram, Twitch and many others is no accident. If the lead lobby group behind the legislation gets its way, it is the stated goal of Bill S-210 to require all Canadians to undergo an age verification system in order to access content on general purpose sites with the threat of penalties and site blocking awaiting those sites that refuse to comply.
