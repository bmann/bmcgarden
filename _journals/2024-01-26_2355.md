Awesome to see [[Farcaster]] continuing to experiment with the [launch of Frames](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0xc7ed9f08).

Matches my thoughts on mobile form and social as distribution / discovery.

Farcaster has less usage than my other two protocol recommendations — [[ATProtocol]] and [[ActivityPub]] — but ability to align login / growth directly with app devs is huge.
