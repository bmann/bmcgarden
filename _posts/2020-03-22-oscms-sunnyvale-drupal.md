On this day, back in March 22nd, 2007, the Open Source CMS Summit that I helped organize was taking place in Sunnyvale at the Yahoo campus. While we had some participation from other communities, the core of it was the Drupal community I was part of.

The website is unforunately malware / domain squatted.

This was a tough time for me. I had a lot of different things going on. I didn't do a good job of delegating or asking for help, and organizing this event pretty much burnt me out. I never really recovered, and I think it was the last Drupal event I organized.

[Dries' announcement post](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo), just a month and a half before the conference date. Hence the burn out. Dries also has a [great photo archive from the event](https://dri.es/album/drupalcon-sunnyvale-2007/). Mainly photos of many lovely community members.

Acquia was founded at OSCMS:

> In March of 2007, I flew from Belgium to California to attend Yahoo's Open Source CMS Summit, where I also helped host DrupalCon Sunnyvale. It was at DrupalCon Sunnyvale where Jay first introduced himself to me. He explained that he was interested in building a company that could provide enterprise organizations supplementary services and support for a number of open source projects, including Drupal and Apache Solr. Initially, I was hesitant to meet with Jay. I was focused on getting Drupal 5 released, and I wasn't ready to start a company until I finished my PhD. Eventually I agreed to breakfast.

[Upcoming.org was still a thing](https://archive.upcoming.org/event/2007-oscms-summit-at-yahoo-150576). Found on @kitt's (archived) user page.

[Walkah was there](https://walkah.net/blog/walkah/open-source-cms-summit-yahoo/) and gave a talk on OpenID. Apparently we were calling this part of the Identity 2.0 movement.

No links I can find right now, but I remember @kellan came in from the city and gave a talk about the Flickr API. He was with @stewart and friends at the Yahoo Brickhouse innovation lab.
