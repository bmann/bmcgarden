<p>I met <a href="http://www.peerproducers.com">Alex Rollin</a> at <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS 2007</a> in Sunnyvale, talking Drupal of course. He's been diving in and kicking ass in all sorts of areas, and is going to be coming to Vancouver to work with the fine folks at <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com">Raincity Studios</a>.</p>

<p>He has made a <a href="http://vancouver.craigslist.org/hou/441355681.html">post to craigslist as to what he's looking for in an apartment</a>. If you have any suggestions, fling them his way...</p>

<p>We had a fun discussion about getting set up with a Canadian cell phone plan. I'm looking forward to blogging the details of that little ordeal :P</p>
