<p>I read the <a href="http://panic.com/extras/audionstory/">True Story of Audion</a> with interest. Here's the short version: they almost got bought by AOL, almost got hired by Apple to build iTunes, and now still make pretty cool stuff. Like <a href="http://panic.com/desktastic/">Desktastic</a>, which almost made me go out and buy a <a href="http://www.macally.com/spec/usb/input_device/icecad.html">graphics tablet</a> today.</p>

<p>Given Panic's record...this probably means Apple is building a Tablet PC :P</p>
