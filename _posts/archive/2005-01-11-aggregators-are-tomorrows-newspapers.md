<p>After my <a title="Macs rule RSS, Custom RSS Apps are next" href="/node/1410">post last night</a>, I woke up to read <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/01/11#theSolutionToTheYahooProblem">Dave's suggestion for one-click subscribe</a>. It would work for web-based aggregators, I suppose, but I don't like the centralization of it all. Couldn't one write a Firefox plugin to set preferred aggregator, and have RSS links automatically shunted to your aggregator? (I moved this talk to the updates at the bottom).</p>

<p>In any case, Dave's mention of all the brands and information providers immediately made me think: newspaper!</p><p>So, these portal sites are likely to have aggregation functions. Editors who pick out the best stories, re-categorize them, some original content creation, and of course advertising. Just like a newspaper.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.byte.org/">Ross's</a> new package for ISPs (<a href="http://skydasher.tucows.com">Skydasher</a>), which includes RSS-powered content blocks, is one step in this direction: run your own MyYahoo.</p>

<p>Oh yes, one more parallel: aggregators take news feeds, equivalent to the custom wire services that newspapers use, and exposes them as &quot;regular&quot; web pages, which is what the mass market reads.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003918.html">Jeremy</a>
(and his comments) pretty much covers the options. For desktop, get a
MIME-type registered. For online, depend on something like Firefox to
hold your preference.</p>

<p>Just thought of this: a &quot;my preferred aggregator&quot; site -- click on
the link, it generates the proper redirect to get the feed added to
your online aggregator of choice.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> yeah, it already exists. See <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/01/centralized_subscription_not_that_way_thanks.php">Phil Ringnalda</a>, where he mentions <a href="http://purl.org/net/syndication/subscribe/">Syndication Subscription Service</a> (via <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">Richard</a>)</p>

<p>It doesn't quite work for &quot;personal&quot; type news aggregation (i.e.
desktop based, but that's where MIME-type would work), but again, the mass market is not likely going to do
this -- they are more likely to customize info in the context of a more
portal-like site.</p>
