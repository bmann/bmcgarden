	Wouldn&#39;t it be great to be able to subscribe to an RSS feed of weather readings? Ideally, there would be several different feeds, from a light, text-only version with just latest temperature and conditions, to a full blown current plus forecast plus humidity plus icons etc. etc. Perhaps even a listing of &quot;local&quot; webcams with pictures of current conditions. Hmmm...I&#39;m going to do some work on figuring out RSS and what kind of information could/should be included. As I had mentioned when I tried to get Environment Canada to offer such a service, an extra-cool feature would be supporting TrackBacks/referrers so that you could see the comments/blog entries that people were making about the weather -- certainly something that people in Canada are likely to do. This would require a centralized server to host the RSS feeds and the comments around them.</p>
