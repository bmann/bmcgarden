[image:717,left,5,5]<p>I wandered into weird corners of the web last night and came across the <a href="http://www.cmsreview.com/timeLines/ShopFeatureDirectory.html">CMSReview Feature Directory</a>. Apparently, it's an example of using "faceted classification" to make a decision.</p>

<p>I found the link through <a href="http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/">Peter Van Dijck's blog</a> -- <a href="http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/archives/002332.html">this other story</a> gives a good example of faceted classification.</p>

<p>Read on to see the choices I made to get those 5 choices listed.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>As you can see from the screenshot, the decision is over what <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> to use. The choices I made were:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> runs on Linux</li>
<li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> PHP</li>
<li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> GPL</li>
<li><strong>Type of CMS:</strong> General</li>
</ol>

<p>(in case you can't read the apps, they are <a href="http://www.ariadne-cms.net/">Ariadne</a>, <a href="http://www.bitflux.ch/developer/cms/">Bitflux</a>, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://www.ez.no/">eZ Publish</a>, and <a href="http://tikiwiki.org/tiki-view_articles.php">Tiki</a>)</p>

<p>I have installed all of the apps listed except for Bitflux. And I'll probably go back and do test installs of all them to remember what they're like. I used the same process (essentially) to pick Drupal for use here, only I did it unconsciously: installing and working with numerous CMS. I instinctively knew what my requirements were</p>
