This was actually our second time on the ice -- we went out with Terrence and Lisa last weekend. These pictures are from last week.

The temperature was really cold last week -- between -20 and -30 -- but the weekend was a bit warmer -- around -10. We were over at <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhodgson/">Ron and Jocelyn's</a> house for dinner on Saturday night. The food and drink were fantastic. They're going to Mexico in April, and talked about a little resort run by a Canadian woman close to the border with Belize. Apparently, you can stay for $380 per week, <strong>including</strong> food! Perhaps the Vegas trip will turn into a Mexico trip...
