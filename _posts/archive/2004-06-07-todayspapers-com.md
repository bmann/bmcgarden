<blockquote>
Have you ever been reading a news article online and wanted to comment on it, but the hosting site didn't provide you with a way to do so? My brother Cameron and his colleague Joe Stump have created an interesting solution--TodaysPapers.com. It's a news aggregator that provides a discussion section for each article. Think of it as Google News + Metafilter. It'll be interesting to watch TodayPapers and see which articles float to the top based on comments, read numbers, and votes.</blockquote>

<p>This looks very interesting. I have lots of questions, but will have to check it out a bit to see if they are answered.</p>
