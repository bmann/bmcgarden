</a><p id="p-0">I just happened to make it to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/yorkdale/">Yorkdale Apple Store</a> today -- the first of its kind in Canada. I was wearing my <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1429">member's t-shirt</a>, but no one was hip enough (Mac geek enough?) to pick up on it. <a href="http://www.walkah.net">James</a> got a picture of me taking a picture, so hopefully that turned out for proof.</p>

<p id="p-1">The store (as you can see from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/sets/362333/">pictures</a>) was crushingly packed. The line up we waited in was because they only let people in as people left -- and it was still hot and sticky from all the people inside. A ton of people were buying iPods of various shapes and sizes and I was tempted.</p>

<p id="p-2">James ended up getting a blue iPod Mini for his wife, along with the iPod car charger he actually needed. The atmosphere was incredible -- everyone was so hyped up and there were so many purchases going on, there was a feeling you HAD to buy something. So I ended up with an iSight, which will go on the desktop at home, since it doesn't have a microphone built in.</p>

<p id="p-3">In an email discussion, Michael Tan sent along a link to <a href="http://www.ehmac.ca/showthread.php?t=24125&page=58&pp=10">more pictures in an EhMac.ca thread</a>. He also said &quot;this reminds me of when Krispe Kreme first opened up in Mississauga&quot; to which Greg responded &quot;I like that Krispy Kreme analogy. AAPL is not a tech company, it's a sugar-as-lifestyle marketing agency.&quot;.</p>

<p id="p-4">Am I a slave to marketing? Don't know, I'm just super comfortable in my Mac ghetto and haven't felt a push for a very long time to leave it. The iPod definitely is a marketing phenomenon...but it also seems to &quot;just work&quot;. Anyway, I'm off to experiment with some webcam software for the new iSight.</p>
