<p>Oh, and everytime I meet an IE team member in the halls (which is quite often) I grab them by the shirt, give them a nugie, and ask them when they are gonna support standards. Someday that's gotta affect them. ;-)</p>
<p>Personally, though, Nigel, you totally missed the boat. Syndication is where the action is. That's what's going to take lowest-common-denominator-platforms (er, the Web) ahead in huge leaps (no matter what platform you like). You should see the traffic graphs for RSS. Doubling every month.</p>

<p>Is <code>nugie4standards.com</code> taken?</p>

<p>On the second point: RSS feels like a bubble. But it feels like a bubble that is going to make more bubbles.</p>
