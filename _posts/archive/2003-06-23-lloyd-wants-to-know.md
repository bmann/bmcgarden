<blockquote>Whatever happened to your link directory of Mac stuff?</blockquote>Well, it's still around. The <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=weblink#view%20the%20weblinks%20directory">weblinks module</a> is a little bit crazy mainly because I'm using a multiple-hierarchy taxonomy. But, there are a few things in the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=weblink&op=view&tid=24&vid=3#All%20things%20Apple%20Macintosh">Mac category</a>.

Also, the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node.php?id=56">Mac OS X book</a> has some stuff. Technically, everything in the Mac category of weblinks should be added to the book outline as well. It's on the to-do list.

Finally, you can of course just sort by the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/index.php?or=24">Mac category</a>, but this will retrieve articles, opinions, and everything (including this post).

Oh, and the link that Lloyd was looking for was <a href="http://www.everymac.com">EveryMac</a> -- the place to look for specs and pricing of virtually all Mac-stuff, ever.
