<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0604a.shtml#saddest">Jeffrey on the new Glassdog and the web</a>. Happy ninth birthday. <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> wasn&#8217;t easy enough, and it isn&#8217;t getting any easier. Blogs aren&#8217;t anything special, they&#8217;re just a function of software that makes it easy to maintain content. Compare the usability of the top 3 blog packages with the top 3 &#8220;content management systems.&#8221; Blogging software is the simplest mechanism for &#8220;In-depth explorations of every imaginable topic.&#8221; That&#8217;s the revolution.
