<p>I&#39;ve been a long time user of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> -- the best desktop news aggregator app on any platform. But I&#39;m switching to Google Reader.</p><p>Reason number one is portability. Forget synching...it just doesn&#39;t work reliably, and I don&#39;t like <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a>&#39;s online version at all. I&#39;m now on my Nokia E61 phone a lot, and the mobile version of Google Reader works great&nbsp;</p><p>Reason number two is that I want to share. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/borismann">delicious postings</a> are one of the main ways I&#39;ve been sharing lightly -- light blog posting in general, except for brief spurts like today. I think that Google Reader will make it easier for me to share. For example, here are all the postings I&#39;ve gathered in <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/09750022241426538111/label/bryght">my &quot;bryght&quot; folder</a>. It&#39;s not ideal --&nbsp; I can only tag, star, or share items, without leaving any commentary as I do in delicious -- but I expect it will get better.</p><p>The big downside of Google Reader? No authenticated feeds. I have many beefs with Google and the way they&#39;re dealing (or not dealing, as the reality is) with identity: this lack of support for authenticated feeds seems another aspect of this.&nbsp;</p><p>So, there you have it: the best feed reading experience that synchs with your mobile is currently Google Reader. <br /></p>
