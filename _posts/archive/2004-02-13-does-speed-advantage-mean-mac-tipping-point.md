title: Does speed advantage mean Mac tipping point?

<p>I'm definitely not a chip guy, but judging by what the guys at <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com">ArsTechnica</a> are reporting about the next generation of G5 chips, this could be the year that the PowerPC architecture (and Mac platform) regain the speed crown from Intel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes folks, a battle is not brewing, it's completely underway. A G5 jump to 2.5 or 3.0 GHz this year would represent a percentage speed increase likely not achievable by either Intel or AMD in that timeframe, the latter not being slated to hit 90nm until the second half of this year. Indeed, <a href="http://www.mdronline.com/watch/watch_abstract.asp?Volname=Issue%20%23117&SID=1068&on=T&SourceID=00000377000000000000" title="Microprocessor Report: IBM Takes the Lead
">MR</a> is betting that come late year, the G5 will be the fastest CPU of of the bunch. The real question is, if that happens, will it also be the most expensive?</p>

<p>Of course, a G4 eMac is still at $1000, and a current PC with monitor can be had for $600. Do iLife's apps tip the balance? Does immunity to viruses hold any cash value? Will a (perceived or otherwise) speed advantage make a difference?</p>

<p>I actually still think platform choices are interesting. Or rather, relative platform choices. I see the Wintel platform beset on all sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Europeans use smartphones more than desktop computers</li>
<li>Linux plus Intel is gaining huge ground in places like Germany and China (plus all the fanless stuff is from VIA, not Intel)</li>
<li>The digerati all have PowerBook G4s</li>
<li>Consumer electronics companies are becoming computing powers in their own right (ref. PlayStation, plus XBox2 is likely going to be PPC powered)</li>
</ul>

<p>Wouldn't it be funny if <strong>Microsoft</strong> had a plan to port Longhorn, their next generation of Windows, to the PPC platform?!!?</p>
