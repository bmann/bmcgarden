<p>If you haven&#39;t been back to LinkedIn for a while, it&#39;s time to check it out again. I&#39;ve written about it in full or passing before -- my favourite title is probably <a href="/node/1420">The first business plan with social networking features: LinkedIn</a>, highlighting the fact that connecting people really is just one aspect of any such service. </p><p>So, why should you go back now? <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers">LinkedIn Answers</a>. It lets you ask questions, answer them, recommend experts and links. It&#39;s definitely going through some growing pains, especially as there are no feedback loops in place to stop people from marketing or pitching rather than really asking questions.</p><p>I&#39;ve been using it for the last 5 days or so....and it&#39;s addictive (bagged my first &quot;expert&quot; star in the Blogging category). The quality of the interaction is quite high, and I actually find myself browsing the questions. That has been my single biggest feedback about LinkedIn (not bad or good, just feedback): you go there when you need something, but there isn&#39;t anything that inherently draws you back. With Answers, that changes.</p><p>One thing I would like to see is increased open-ness from the system. Answers is exactly the sort of thing that should be out in the open, for many of the questions and answers. Any decent answer I post is likely of high enough quality that it should be posted out on my blog, available to the &quot;open Internet&quot;. Having an account on LinkedIn is a fine barrier for interacting, but the content itself should be publicly permalinkable. Yes, LinkedIn is an identity system with reputation built in...wonder when they will connect to an open standard. </p>
<p>If you want to give feedback directly, I started a question inside Answers: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers?viewQuestion=&questionID=7704&askerID=1746">Suggestions on how LinkedIn Answers should evolve</a>.</p>
