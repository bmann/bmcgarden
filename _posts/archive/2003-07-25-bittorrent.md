I'm completing my first <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a> download<a href="#btdownload">*</a>

BitTorrent is one of those geeky things that's been floating around for quite some time, but I just hadn't had the opportunity/inclination to try out yet. Since all the mirrors were in Europe, I thought I would give it a shot. Apparently I'm connected to 6 peers, and am downloading at roughly 155kbps (pretty close to the max on my DSL line, which magically got upgraded from 1Mbps to 1.5Mbps recently). There are clients for all the OSs, and it seems to work pretty well, so no reason not to try it.

<a name="btdownload">*</a>it's an ISO of <a href="http://www.opengroupware.org">OpenGroupware</a> compiled into a <a href="http://www.opengroupware.org/en/knoppix/index.html#download">Knoppix CD</a> -- a Linux-based Exchange replacement demo that you can boot off a CD!
