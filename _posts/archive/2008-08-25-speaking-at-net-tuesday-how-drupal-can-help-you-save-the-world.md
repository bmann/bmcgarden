	Just as <a href="http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon Szeged</a> is kicking off, I&#39;ll be talking at this coming week&#39;s <a href="http://netsquared.meetup.com/15/calendar/8360780/">Net Tuesday event, &quot;How Drupal can help you save the world!&quot;</a>. Boy, that <a href="http://engagejoe.com">Joe Solomon</a> really does like catchy titles :P</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll be kicking things off with an intro to Drupal. I&#39;ll talk a bit about open source and how it relates / meshes with the mission of non profits. Or rather, why the heck aren&#39;t you using your non profit DNA to work together with other organizations?! I&#39;ll also do lots of my &quot;question&quot; tactics -- asking people in the room to think about their strategy, their use of the web, their use of open source software, and their approach to engagement online.</p>
<p>
	Following me will be the folks from <a href="http://www.fearlesscity.ca/">Fearless City</a> and <a href="http://www.agentic.ca/">Agentic</a> talking about some case studies.</p>
<p>
	The event is this Tuesday, August 26th, at 5:30pm at <a href="http://abetterplacetowork.com">WorkSpace</a>. The Meetup event is now closed, but you can show your <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=27223426299">attendance on Facebook</a> or <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1041412">upcoming</a>.</p>
<p>
	P.S. yeah, I said I wasn&#39;t really going to post event stuff here much anymore, putting most of it on the <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com" title="Vancouver startup accelerator">Bootup Labs blog</a>. Well, this is an event that I&#39;m doing &quot;solo&quot; as it were. And never fear, I&#39;m going to post over on Bootup about the <a href="http://www.eeroadshow.com">Expression Engine Roadshow</a><a>.</a></p>
