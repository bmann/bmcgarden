<p><a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000214.html">The article</a> talks about guarding our time and relationships as social networking sites grow.</p>

<p>This neatly parallels some recent experiences of mine with LinkedIn. <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2003/12/social_networki.html">Scott Loftesness</a> (which is where I saw the pointer to the article) echoes thoughts I had on LinkedIn a while back:</p>

<blockquote>
I'm finding there's just not much of a "there there" for me. Nothing that draws me back to regular usage. Somehow expanding LinkedIn's view of my network just doesn't get me excited -- like they think it should! There's certainly nothing there I'd be willing to actually pay LinkedIn for!

<p><a href="http://www.tribe.net">Tribe.net</a> and the Vancouver-based <a href="http://www.zerendipity.com">Zerendipity</a> are much more interesting to spend time at. Perhaps in part because I've limited connections there to "people I've met in person"?</p>
