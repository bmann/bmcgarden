I helped get <a href="http://blog.haggaret.com/" rel="friend met">Kevin Haggerty</a> and <a href="http://jamie.bmannconsulting.com" rel="friend met">Jamie Molloy</a> blogging.

Kevin's running it on his <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/861">e-smith server</a> and Jamie's running on my e-smith box. Both are using <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> as their blogging software.

I can easily install WordPress in just a few seconds now, so if anyone wants a blog, let me know. I've put up a sort of <a href="http://blog.bmannconsulting.com/">support site</a>. Anyone can also <a href="http://blog.bmannconsulting.com/wp-register.php">register</a> and post immediately (to both test WordPress and to provide a place to put feedback, questions, etc.).

Your blog will live at <code>http://blog.bmannconsulting.com/[your-name]/</code> unless you arrange something different with me.

(Graham -- I know you <a href="http://gfair.blogspot.com/">have a blog</a>; I tried to use this <a href="http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1">Atom to RSS</a> converter to get feeds from it, but it just gives errors)
