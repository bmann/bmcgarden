<p>Mark's comments in response to an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/business/worldbusiness/05canada.html?ex=1399089600&en=13703900736eb8c9&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND" title="No registration - thanks Richard Eriksson">NYT article</a>.</p><blockquote>
A more accurate take is that the Internet is allowing new competitors to enter the market without having to make massive infrastructure investments. This environment compares with the late-1990s when competitive carriers such as <a href="http://www.angustel.ca/update/up294.html#NORIGEN IN RECEIVERSHIP">Norigen </a>and OCI Communications took a stab at taking on Bell Canada - only to fail miserably after spending hundreds of millions of dollars. Before VOIP takes off in Canada, there needs to be regulatory changes that has kept the price of local service at low levels. VOIP also needs to become more user-friendly so that its installation in a multi-phone household can be plug and play. <cite><a href="http://evans.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/5/51931.html">Mark Evans: VOIP in Canada</a></cite></blockquote>
