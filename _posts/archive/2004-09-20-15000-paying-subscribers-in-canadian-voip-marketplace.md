<p>According to last week's National Post VoIP <A href="http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=d492a4dd-ffcf-44f5-9f4e-6fc5e0781e73">story</a>, there are about 15,000 people in Canada who pay for voice over broadband services across multiple providers.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://www.freeworldialup.com/">Free World Dialup</a> user demographics, there are about 15,000 people in Canada who have a Free World Dialup account.</p>

<p>Sorry, Jeff, but I have to disagree. If we use these sorts of numbers, we can probably just as easily say that iChat users are amongst the leaders in the Canadian VoIP marketplace. I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/373">have a FWD account</a> but I've only used it perhaps twice right after I got it -- it's just not easy enough to use.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm still pulling for Jeff when he speaks to the <acronym title="Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission">CRTC</acronym>.</p>
