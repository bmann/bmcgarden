<p>Have I mentioned that most of these startup / tech events I'm posting full details on at the <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs blog</a>? For now, you'll have to suffer the cross posting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/DemoCampVictoria01">April 3rd: DemoCampVictoria01</a>, with Mark Lise posting a <a href="http://www.digitalspace.ca/2008/03/20/buzz-buzz-around-democampvictoria">buzz summary on his blog</a> -- anyone else heading over to Victoria for this?</li>
<li><a href="">April 10th: DemoCampVancouver06</a>, a full posting including <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2008/03/24/democampvancouver06-gaming-edition-on-april-10th-2008/">speaker details over on BUL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/">April 14th - 15th: Open Web Vancouver</a>, a great new event put on mainly by the Vancouver PHP crew that is expanding to cover the entire "open" web.</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit of an embarrassment of riches, really. We've got lots of great tech related events happening here in Vancouver, and more to come.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> oh, yeah, and of course <a href="http://bridging-media.com/">Bridging Media</a> is this coming weekend, March 29th, but I think they may already be full (I'm speaking).</p>
