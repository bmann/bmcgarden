	The NOAA have started experimenting with an <a href="http://weather.gov/alerts/">alerts page</a> offering both RSS and XML feeds. The XML feed is <acronym title="Common Alerting Protocol">CAP</acronym>, or Common Alerting Protocol. There is a <a href="http://www.incident.com/cap/what-why-how.html">mini-FAQ</a> explaining CAP. It is briefly described on the NOAA page:</p>
<blockquote>
	Common Alertings Protocol (CAP) is an non-proprietary standard data format for the interchange of hazard warning and reports.</blockquote>
<p>
	This is an experimental service, and any comments should be submitted to the <a href="http://weather.gov/survey/nws-survey.php?code=rss-cap-wwa">feedback page</a> by December 30, 2003. Submitted comments will &quot;help determine the future of the product&quot;.</p>
<p>
	News of this was posted to the <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/em/H/aZRarGycKBuyE/" title="RSS Weather QuickTopic">RSS Weather</a> mailing list. You can view (and respond) using the web forum, as well as subscribe to the list.</p>
