I talked quite some time ago about <a href="/node/view/207">Spaces</a>. A blog entry over at <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1562.html">Sam Ruby</a> bumped me on over to <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002261.html">another entry</a>. I was reading it, and it was interesting, but I was getting a strange deja-vu feeling.<br>
<br>
So, <em>Spaces</em> has become <a href="http://www.clevercactus.com">Clever Cactus</a>, and is now at beta2. Which, in turn, is still kind of like <a href="http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/">Zoe</a>. Which I ran again for a while the other day, but too many rough edges. Or rather, the non-permanence of running something that is a server on what is a client machine.<br>
<br>
I've downloaded Clever Cactus and will be giving it a whirl. 
<!--break-->From the front page:
<blockquote>
We live in a connected, mobile world where we want to share information easily with people and groups             who cross many boundaries and domains: colleagues, family and friends. We use many devices (work and home PCs, laptops, PDAs and cell phones) and applications (email, IM, and weblogs) to achieve this.<br> 
<br>
clevercactus connects people and information directly across multiple devices and environments. It runs on all major operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, OS/2, and others.

It's Java, and the UI is, um <em>"not complete for the Macintosh version"</em>.
