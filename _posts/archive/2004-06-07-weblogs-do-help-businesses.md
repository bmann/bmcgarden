<blockquote>
When I look over the past year, it's very clear to me what an incredible value this weblog has been to Common Craft. As I started thinking about founding the company, I knew I needed a way to promote myself and I really wanted people to get to know me- the person. I wanted the market and my niche to have a way to see how I think, work, write. I was prepared to take the risk that people may not agree with me or like me for that matter, because I knew that the ones that did feel a connection would make the difference.
