<p>I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1488">explained del.icio.us as easy shared bookmarks</a> a while back. There is a lot more development going on, and the del.icio.us team is obviously watching their users. I first saw the "for" tag used/explained on <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2005/07/forbradfeld.html">Brad Feld's blog</a>, and then it <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FeldThoughts?m=486">got implemented</a>.</p>

<p>Richard explains its use, but you really need to click through and read his whole, much longer post on what social software means to him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/07/tags_for_two.html">del.icio.us introduced the for: tag</a>, which you use to &ldquo;send&rdquo; links to people.  It has a &ldquo;private&rdquo; RSS feed&mdash;probably would have been smarter for them to require your del.icio.us username and password to download it, since it&rsquo;s a) technically possible and b) more secure&mdash;and anything tagged with that, only people access to that username&rsquo;s account can view all the stuff tagged as such.  So, if you want to &ldquo;send&rdquo; me something, tag it as <code>for:sillygwailo</code> and I&rsquo;ll find out about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Basic summary: tag stuff with for:[delicious-user-name], and that person will get private notification of that link -- the digital equivalent of tapping someone on the shoulder and telling them to "look over there".</p>
