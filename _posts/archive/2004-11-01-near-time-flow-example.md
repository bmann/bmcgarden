<p>OK, Scott, I'm keeping the post up this time. It works! It does rich text editing, too, and the HTML is pretty clean.<br /></p>

<blockquote>For example, if you would like to post content discovered while browsing the web or viewing your RSS feeds in Flow, just select the appropriate text and choose Post Selection to Blog from the Share menu. You will be presented with a list of the blog accounts you've added to Flow. Pick the appropriate  space and folio (which will be the category for the post if your blog supports categories.) Flow will copy the selected text into a new page within the selected space.  Add any commentary and click the Post button on the toolbar to post the page to your blog.</blockquote>
