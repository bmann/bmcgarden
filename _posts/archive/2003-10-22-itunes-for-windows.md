I wasn't going to post anything about this, but Greg sent links to a couple of "Rants & Raves" at Wired News (both should be on <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/rants/0,2350,60897,00.html">this page</a>). Since I wrote up a long-ish email in response anyway, I might as well post it here as well.

The first one concerns problems connecting to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/" title="iTunes Music Store">iTMS</a>, the second is a complaint that iTunes for Windows can't transfer music to anything other than an iPod.

I'll address these two issues separately.

<blockquote>I sent an e-mail through the Apple website describing the trouble, and got two responses back. Both said that if I was running an Internet security program, firewall or proxy connection, I wouldn't be able to connect to the store. I would have to shut down the firewall.</blockquote>
Don't know what the guy is talking about. I have it installed on my WinXP box, and it connects to iTMS no problem (through both a Linux box running a firewall as well as a 3Com broadband router). Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if something like Norton blocked it...

Not supporting other players: chicken and egg; Apple wants to stick with AAC -- iPods are the only device that support AAC. Be interesting to see what makes Apple blink -- support for stuff other than AAC, or non-iPod devices. Since their DRM solution seems to be pretty much entwined with AAC, I don't think that will change. I'm sure that Apple is out there beating the bushes, trying to make it attractive for companies to add AAC into their next round of products...

And of course, this "problem" only exists for music downloaded from iTMS. I bet that music-service-X and their DRM solution don't allow transferring to <strong>all</strong> MP3 playing devices...

It would be interesting to see how many people actually have MP3 players, as opposed to burning Audio CDs and/or MP3 CDs. I don't have anything that can play MP3s except for my computers (well, I did just get <a href="http://www.acomdata.com/scripts/products-showdetails.asp?id=65" title="Acom Data Multi Media Viewer">one of these</a>, but I didn't exactly buy it as an MP3 player).

By the way -- iTunes Win works great on my network. All my music stored on my Mac (actually on an external firewire hard drive connected to it) shows up as a shared library, and everything streams across the network auto-magically. I see no massive CPU usage or other problems that have been reported.
