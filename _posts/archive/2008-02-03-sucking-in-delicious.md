<p>I finally took a little time to update to the latest <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feedapi">Feed API</a> and start sucking in my <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/feed-item/2218">Delicious links</a>. I'm not quite ready to mix it into my Feedburner feed, since I want to do mapping of the link field to my "native" weblink type, as well as the tags aren't transferring across.</p>

<p>The big thing this enables is commenting on my delicious notes. Meta observations on the link in question. As <a href="http://justagwailo.com">Richard</a> has previously noted, my <a href="http://boris.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> instance actually also provides this: a second permalink where comments are enabled.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.allconsuming.net">All Consuming</a> is the other web service that I'm definitely interested in sucking back in here. I've been keeping it fairly up to date with my reading, and I know lots of people that also like to read similar books. RSS as the simplest systems integration format. Fun times!</p>
