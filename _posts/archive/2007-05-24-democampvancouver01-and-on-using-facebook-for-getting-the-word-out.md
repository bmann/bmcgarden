<p>Why yes, I <strong>am</strong> continuing the tradition of not-real-blogging-its-just-about-event-posting :P</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver01"><img src="http://barcamp.org/f/vancouverdemocamp.png" border="0" /></a></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, the first <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver01">DemoCampVancouver01</a>, held at <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">WorkSpace</a>, is over. And no blog post ahead of time from me! </p><p>But that, in part, is what this post is about.</p><p>See, I procrastinated making a post. I used a bunch of channels to get the word out about this event. I added some subtle links in earlier posts to this blog, I made an entry on Upcoming.org, we made a mailing list, and then....and then I decided to experiment with Facebook.</p><p>I created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2426652061">DemoCampVancouver group</a>, and I made an event posting, and I invited all my friends. And Facebook has this built in ability to pass on these type of postings/notifications, and it spread even further. As of today, there are almost 100 members in the Facebook group.</p><p>So, Facebook works. It helped that WorkSpace promoted the event &quot;live&quot; to all its members, who are naturally an entrepreneurial group of people. But...well, even with the talk of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/05/24/live-at-the-facebook-launch/">Facebook as platform</a>, it&#39;s inherently closed nature, it&#39;s non-participation in the open web...bugs me.</p><p>Isn&#39;t this why I&#39;m working on identity? So we can build Facebook in a distributed matter, everywhere? </p><p>...but I digress. The evening was great, we had about 50 people out, way more interest in presenting that there was time for, and a really engaged/interesting/awesome group of people. Look to the various channels of the Internet universe for more info, check out the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/democampvancouver">DemoCampVancouver tag</a>, and we&#39;ll update the <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">wiki</a> with more information. Thanks to all for coming out, tell all your many tribes about this, and let&#39;s get prepped for some Powerpoint Karaoke for next time...</p> <!--break--> <p>Next event with a subtle link? Come out next <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/4077">Thursday for May&#39;s League of Vancouver Drupal-ers at our Bryght offices</a>, with a presentation on &quot;Achieving Awesome Design with Drupal&quot;.Â </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
