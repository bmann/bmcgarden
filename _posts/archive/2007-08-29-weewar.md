<p><a href="http://www.hopstudios.com/nep/">Travis</a> and <a href="http://www.unfavorablepink.com/">Susie</a> got me playing <a href="http://weewar.com?referrer=boris">WeeWar</a>. Caution: do not click during a work day. Although, luckily, you can set "turns" to be as long as an entire day, so you don't necessarily need to be glued to your screen. I think we'll see more of these fun, casual, browser-based games.</p>

<p>Now, off to see if my Heavy Trooper and Raider strategy is working...</p>
