<p>
	I&#39;m very happy to see that two of my favourite tools are now working together. I provided a <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3986974.htm">quote to the press release</a>, since <a href="http://twitter.com/bmann/status/12074032895">my Twitter of my GetSatisfaction post</a> kicked off the discussion between the companies. BatchBook also has a <a href="http://blog.batchblue.com/batchbook-launches-easy-scheduling-with-tungle/">blog post up</a>.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Want to book a meeting with me / check my availability ? Head over to my <a href="http://tungle.me/boris">Tungle profile</a>.</p>
<p>
	Tungle helps me keep my sanity by making meeting booking not my problem. I don&#39;t have to juggle lots of different back-and-forth email threads as I try and schedule my next week&#39;s worth of meetings &ndash; it&#39;s up to people that want to meet with me to suggest times in slots that are available.</p>
<p>
	It doesn&#39;t hurt that they&#39;re a Canadian startup on a roll. Why don&#39;t I have more to rave about with Tungle? They handle my multiple business and personal calendars and &quot;just do it&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Want to get in touch or need a referral? Fill out my <a href="http://batchblue.com">Batchbook</a>-powered <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> or ask me to search my contact database for people and firms with specific skillsets.</p>
<p>
	Batchbook is in the class of &quot;social CRMs&quot;. I guess that means it&#39;s interface is from the current decade, and it integrates things like Twitter profiles and RSS feeds as part of each contact. But I have much more to say about Batchbook.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>
	I was going to say &quot;my favourite part&hellip;&quot;, but in reality I use a ton of different features that Batchbook has. Tags for contacts make it easy to slice and dice, but it&#39;s &quot;Super Tags&quot; that are really awesome. Tag someone with a previously defined Super Tag, and you can add additional fields of data. For example, I have a &quot;drupal person&quot; tag that lets me add a person&#39;s nickname in the Drupal community, a direct link to their d.o. user account, and a yes/no on if they are part of the Drupal Association. I also have a Partner tag, that lets me check off specific skillsets that people or companies have, as well as their usual hourly rate / typical project size.</p>
<p>
	From these tags and Super Tag fields, you can then create custom reports and lists, to easily browse collections of people or companies.</p>
<p>
	From *there*, you can do cool integration-y things like set up a <a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>&nbsp;mailing lists which stays in sync just by tagging contacts. And yes, it syncs with Google Contacts, too.</p>
<p>
	Deal tracking and much more are all possible. Check out the <a href="http://batchblue.com/screencasts.html">extensive list of Batchbook screencasts</a> to get more of an idea of what&#39;s possible.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m thinking of doing a Batchbook intro / user group / sharing session in Vancouver in the coming weeks. Leave a comment if you&#39;re interested, and I&#39;ll let you know when and where.</p>
