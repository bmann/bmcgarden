<p>No, it&#39;s not a drug, it&#39;s the Semantic Web :P</p><p><a href="http://www.freebase.com">Freebase</a> is sort of like a structured wiki. In that, anyone can add content to the system. What&#39;s different, is that you can also add and define your own &quot;Type&quot; which are a collection of metadata. User generated content is quite common, and Freebase actually sucks in a ton of information from Wikipedia which gives it a huge base of content to start with, but this concept of being able to add/edit/organize higher level structures and metadata is new (tagging aside...). </p><p>I had great fun fleshing out entries for <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view?id=%239202a8c04000641f8000000000131038">Drupal</a> and the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/api/metaweb/view?id=%239202a8c04000641f8000000004f41d73">Drupal Association</a>, figuring out Company, Software, and People types in the process.</p><p>OK, OK, I admit -- filling in the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/filter?id=/food/beer">Beer</a> entries for <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view?id=%239202a8c04000641f8000000004f4214e">Hacker-Pschorr Weisse</a> and the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view?id=%239202a8c04000641f80000000006304db">Hacker-Pschorr Brewery</a> were actually more fun :P</p><p>A couple of pieces of feedback on Freebase:</p><ul><li>A bit slow: some of the actions/dropdowns don&#39;t seem as snappy as they could be</li><li>URLs are ugly as sin: there is no perfect way to do this, but the URLs simply aren&#39;t &quot;friendly&quot; at all</li><li>Feature request - extend types: I couldn&#39;t figure out how to extend an existing type with extra metadata&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I can certainly understand <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/freebase_will_p_1.html">Tim O&#39;Reilly&#39;s great praising of Freebase</a> (and, of course, similar concepts like my old &quot;blog friend&quot; <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">Nova Spivack</a>&#39;s company, <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">Radar Networks</a>) -- it&#39;s how the entire web *should* work.</p><p>So, when I link to a page, the page that I link to should show a link back to my post (it&#39;s called a referrer or trackback...except we can&#39;t use them in practice because of spam). And that &quot;link&quot; is a structured piece of content, that may have extra metadata and values associated with it (e.g. if it&#39;s been on Digg, how many Diggs it has, if it&#39;s a spam domain, a link to another &quot;owner&quot; person, etc.). </p><p>Spam aside, we still have these &quot;static&quot; web pages that can&#39;t fully participate in this more interactive web. Some of the smarts are migrating to individual pages themselves. I&#39;ve always believed this, and have long predicted the &quot;death of static pages&quot;.</p><p>But enough pontificating. Go experiment with Freebase, and the first person to mention Web 3.0 *will* get a slap.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> so, yeah, I&#39;m sorry that I don&#39;t have any invites to give out yet. I didn&#39;t realize that Freebase was, um, as closed as it is still. Leave a note in the comments if you want an invite, and I&#39;ll hand them out as I get some.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 2:</strong> OK, I&#39;ve got invites. Leave a comment in this thread or <a href="/contact">email me</a> if you want one.&nbsp;</p>
