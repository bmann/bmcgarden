<p>Woah.  Very cool that I can log into anyone's Drupal site using my very own Drupal account.</p>
<p>
Community building at it's best.

In regards to our <a href="http://shard.servebeer.com/?q=node/view/10#comment">comments</a> on my site...
</p>
<p>
I was playing with the Site Cloud and you were right - damn it's useless.  I figured it could display RSS feeds, but the News Feed mod apparently is what I was looking for.

As for theming - the crappy start I have on my site is actually a modification of an existing theme.  I used it as a starting point but I think I'll take a look at the Xtemplate instead.  I found an interesting theme called tableless (actually I found it by searching for themes on your site) but I think I'll look at XTemplate first and see what interesting things I can do with it.
