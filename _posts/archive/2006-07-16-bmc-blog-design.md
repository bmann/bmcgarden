I started talking to Cathy perhaps 6 months ago or so, before she got snapped up by <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com">Raincity Studios</a> (she also works with Alex Williams, doing work on the <a href="http://www.podcasthotel.com">Podcast Hotel</a>).</p><p>Of course, it has the requisite <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">&quot;Photo by Kris Krug&quot;</a>, and this screenshot is of an interior &quot;static&quot; page. Green would be a new colour for me...I long ago picked dark blue plus the yellow-gold highlight as &quot;my&quot; colours....but then, I don&#39;t even have a real brand for BMC other than my name itself. Maybe I should go shopping for a new domain name as well?<br /></p><p>The big task, which really should come before the design, is to re-examine my info architecture. There is a lot of different type of info on this site, and I also have content in several external places I would like to highlight/integrate a bit better (e.g. sync local <a href="/weblink">weblinks</a> with my <a href="http://del.icio.us/borismann">del.icio.us</a> account, have posts from my <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann">Bryght blog</a> appear here and perhaps vice versa).</p><p>One of those spots is the &quot;personal&quot; side of me. It lives over at <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">personal.bmannconsulting.com</a> for those that are interested, and is an aggregation of content produced by me on many other sites (the 43 universe, like <a href="http://www.43places.com">43 places</a>, being a major source).&nbsp;</p><p>And along with design comes thinking about content...I&#39;m going to try not to veer off into &quot;blogging about blogging&quot;, but I should definitely be doing more short snippets of thought here -- I admire <a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/">Sacha</a>, <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com">Paul</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackrimmedglasses.com">Ethan</a>&#39;s styles in particular, in terms of frequency, type, and length of content. </p>
