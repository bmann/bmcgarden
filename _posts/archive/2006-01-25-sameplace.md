<p><a href="/blog/bmann/2006-will-be-the-year-of-xmpp#comment-107939">hyperstruct left a comment</a> announcing the developer preview release of this Firefox 1.5 plugin. It enables &quot;real time social browsing&quot; with an integrated Jabber IM client. Every URL creates a separate chatroom, so you can IM to other people that are viewing the same page as you.</p><p>I haven't tried it out yet, since I haven't upgraded to Firefox 1.5 yet. Soon!&nbsp;</p>
