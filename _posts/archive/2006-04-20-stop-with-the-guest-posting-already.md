<p>Um, can we stop with the guest posting already? If I wanted to subscribe to other people....I&#39;d subscribe to them. We have a time honoured tradition of pointing to off-blog content...it&#39;s called a &quot;link&quot;, or perhaps a &quot;quote&quot;.</p>  <p>Want to have more than one &quot;voice&quot;? Great...there are lots of different systems that allow more than one person to blog.</p>  <p>And let me name names -- <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a>, <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a>, and <a href="http://gigaom.com/">Om</a>. Please, stop. Or have a separate, guest blog feed that I can *choose* to subscribe to.</p>  <p>Thanks for listening to the rant.</p>
