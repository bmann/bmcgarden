<p>Well, before I knew it, <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/">DrupalCamp Vancouver</a> has snuck up on me. I mean it when I say it snuck up on me: I had pretty much zero to do with organizing it -- massive kudos have to go to <a href="http://uncleweed.net">Dave Olson</a>, <a href="http://www.group42.ca">Dale McGladdery</a>, and <a href="http://www.westendgirl.ca">Ariane K</a> (I know there are others, like the guys from <a href="http://www.imagexmedia.com">Image X Media</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jkparker">jkparker</a> on kick off party duty and and and...).</p>

<p>DrupalCamp Vancouver is this Friday and Saturday, May 9th and 10th, with a kick off party on Thursday night. As with all Drupal events, it's sold out (how are we ever going to fix this? more training!), and it looks like a great group of people are going to be gathering.</p>

<p>I spent this morning with Dale and Ariane reviewing the session submissions. We have a nice mix of newcomer, developer, and soft topics, as well as 2+ double sessions: one on organic groups, and one on design and theming. I say "2+" because we tried to schedule the talks so they "fit" together nicely -- like the back to back views + arguments segueing into panels 2, or the intro to module development that then continues with forms API advanced development. The <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/sessions">sessions are up</a> -- but the presenters are still "in progress" of being contacted.</p>

<p>I'll be doing a talk on <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/node/67">install profiles</a> with a couple of co-presenters, and leading a close out session on <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/node/68">Drupal 6 and beyond</a>. Frankly, I'm more than a little worried about Drupal 6, while at the same time so looking forward to Drupal 7, testing frameworks, and more <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rdf">RDF</a>. It will be interesting to see how the discussion goes.</p>

<p>There are lots of talks to look forward to (I know lots of people have been asking about an <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/node/60">intro to SVN</a>). I've got my eye on the infamous <a href="http://heyrocker.com">heyrocker</a> -- he's coming up to talk about the gnarly issue of <a href="http://www.drupalcampvancouver.org/node/66">staging Drupal between servers</a>. It would be great if we could pool our solutions and get to more *code* in this area. I think drush is likely the proper building block.</p>

<p>Again, thanks so much to the organizing team that pulled this together: we're lucky to have such a great group of motivated people.</p>

<p>If you are missing DrupalCamp here in Vancouver, the next two I know of are <a href="http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/">DrupalCamp Toronto</a> May 23rd - 24th and <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcamp-seattle">DrupalCamp Seattle</a> June 26th - 27th.</p>
