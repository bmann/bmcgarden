	One of the biggest problems with large mailing lists is that there is usually a core group of really good contributors, and then large masses (often new subscribers) that just send out the same &quot;How do I...?&quot; or other &quot;noise&quot; type questions that could easily be answered by reading the manual or checking out the frequently asked questions page.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2004/02/17/171.aspx">This article by K. Scott Allen</a> made me think about some changes to mailing lists that might help with the signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>
	The basic idea is to implement a sort of karma or ratings system for mailing list subscribers, much like <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">kuro5hin</a>.</p>
<p>
	Each subscriber could set their threshold, so some users might choose to receive only the best posts, from the core group.</p>
<p>
	New members might have a certain trial period, or some other way for their posts to be seen following their initial sign up.</p>
<p>
	Karma rankings for individual users and/or posts could be done by a set of moderators, through a web interface. Alternately, any person could give feedback about a post by sending mail commands back to the list server -- e.g. forwarding it to a separate address, like &quot;list-karma&quot;, and having +1, -2, etc. listed on the first line.</p>
