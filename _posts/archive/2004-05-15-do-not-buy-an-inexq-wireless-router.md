<p>Unless, of course, you want a lot of grief.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The problems come down to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>the firewall blocks legitimate outgoing connections (like to my IMAP server); having to turn the firewall off is not a nice option, but it's your only choice</li>
<li>the submit page for setting the address of a DMZ machine is broken, meaning you have to port forward a bunch of things manually</li>
<li>the range/power of the 802.11g wireless is pathetic -- I didn't even get full bars a scant few feet away</li>
<li>for some reason, even though I manually port-forwarded web connections to my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/e-smith">home server</a>, I could not connect to any domains hosted there from behind the router; external connections worked fine</li>
<li>for the absolute crowning glory of all these problems, the InexQ website is inexplicably VBScript powered; I had hoped that firmware upgrades might solve some of these problems, but I can't even download them because you have to be running IE on Windows for that section of the website to even function; luckily, a friend with this combination went to the web page, clicked on the download link, and promptly received 404 errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should have been warned by the fact that a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=inexq&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">search for InexQ</a> returns <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,8578616~mode=flat">InexQ crap</a> as the second hit.</p>

<p>I think everyone can safely stay away from all InexQ products. Forever.</p>
