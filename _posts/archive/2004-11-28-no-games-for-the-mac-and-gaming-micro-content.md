When you tell someone you're buying a Mac and they throw the No_Mac_Game FUD in your face, they're being lazy. Someone, somewhere, at some time, told them that &quot;Mac Games Suck&quot; and that's simple idea to remember. FUD paints a world of black and white and the good news is it's all gray people.

<p>I thought this was appropriate since I am (still) enjoying World of Warcraft. Pretty much all of <a href="http://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard's</a> games are cross-platform, and usually ship with one set of CDs as well. Actually, the guys at Electronic Boutique where I bought the game almost didn't want to sell it to me when I mentioned I was playing on a Mac.</p>

<p>I don't care to get involved in the FUD one way or another -- if I was really interested in playing games I would get an Xbox or a PlayStation.</p>

<p>Something else that I wanted to point out was the other company referenced in Rands' post: <a href="http://www.bioware.com">Bioware</a>.</p>

<p>Their main products are based around the <acronym title="Dungeons & Dragons">DnD</acronym> role-playing system -- they've used it to development the fantasy-based Neverwinter Nights as well as the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. But both are platforms (with NN being more of one).</p>

<p>Neverwinter Nights ships with full development tools. You can make your own modules, including full scripting abilities, your own persistent servers, etc. etc. Every pen-and-paper RPG playing nerds fantasy.</p>

<p>And now Bioware has opened up a <a href="http://store.bioware.com">store</a>. Small, high-quality, very inexpensive modules that you can play after you've finished the main "game". This goes beyond mods or add-ons for other games -- these modules are completely self-contained, and need only the original platform purchase to enable people to start playing.</p>

<p>Theoretically individuals could start charging for these modules as well. Gaming micro-content, which has been out of reach because of the now millions of dollars that is required to develop (and more importantly, market) a game.</p>

<p>I see modular sales like this as being another valid business model vs. online games like World of Warcraft that charge ongoing subscription fees.</p>

<p>Interesting times. I'm off to go summon some demons with my gnome engineer.</p>
