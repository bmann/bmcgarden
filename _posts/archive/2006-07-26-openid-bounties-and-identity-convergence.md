<p>Scott Kveton <a href="http://kveton.wordpress.com/2006/07/26/openid-code-bounty/">announced</a> the <a href="http://iwantmyopenid.org/bounty">OpenID Code Bounty</a> at OSCON today: </p><blockquote> <p>Integrate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> into your open source project and we&rsquo;ll give $5,000 to your project.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve seen OpenID really start to gain some momentum over the past couple of months and this Bounty program is really the exclamation point on that.  There is a great <a href="http://iwantmyopenid.org">list of sponsors</a> for the program that includes people, organizations and businesses focused on building a simple, light-weight and decentralized user-centric identity platform around OpenID.  Working with all of these people over the last couple of weeks has proven to me that convergence is really happening around OpenID.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I wasn&#39;t really a fan of the &quot;original&quot; OpenID spec. That is, it worked great, but only solved single sign-on. Then the <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension">Simple Registration Protocol</a>, or SRP, got kludged in. This supports only 9 -- and exactly 9 -- attributes, and is not extensible. So, colour me firmly in the SXIP camp at this point.</p>  <p>Now, <a href="http://sxip.com/newsitem-sxip_joins_consortium_funding_openid_development">SXIP is helping to fund the OpenID bounties</a>, and OpenID is further evolving. There is a <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0-05.html">5th draft of OpenID 2.0</a>, which still has profile information as separate, and Scott Kveton was earlier <a href="http://kveton.wordpress.com/2006/07/25/oscon-openid-and-convergence/">talking about OpenID v3 and convergence</a>.</p>  <p>So...lots of pieces still coming together. The bounty announcement is, on the one hand, a good idea (something that SXIP should have done years ago...except for the fact that the spec keeps changing); on the other hand...we want to make sure that the best solution is implemented. Perhaps OpenID as the lowest common denominator for basic single sign on interoperability is a good start.</p>  <p>Is Bryght going to join the consortium to help fund bounties? Well, we don&#39;t have that kind of cash -- we are self-funded after all. We will work on making sure that OpenID works well with Drupal and Jabber.</p>
