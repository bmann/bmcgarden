<p>Don't believe the rumours. <strong>I've</strong> got the real scoop. It's going to be a tablet!</p>
<p>I wrote up my <a href="/node/1424">Mac tablet predictions</a> earlier, but let's do a recap:</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
    <li>screen-only interface and form factor, like the <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start;sid=Y-Ku6ptqMryu2NlChAak4dRnvn4cmxc2C-w=?CategoryName=tv_LocationFreeTVs&amp;Dept=tv">Sony LocationFree TVs</a>, except done right</li>
    <li>runs full OS X, just on an under-powered G4, so a bunch of heavy duty apps like Photoshop won't necessarily run well</li>
    <li>Airport and Bluetooth built-in</li>
    <li>stylus interface; attach Apple Bluetooth keyboard and mouse if you want direct input</li>
    <li>it's a remote for your &quot;main&quot; iTunes/iPhoto system</li>
</ul>
<p>What's the target? Basically, even-smaller-form factor plus remote control of other systems plus remote viewing (iPhoto, movies)/listening around the house. I could see myself using it in meetings etc. -- easy/quick &quot;on the go&quot; note taking where tablets excel.</p>
<p>It also &quot;solves&quot; the problem of the 10-foot interface: give people a 1 foot interface to <strong>control</strong> their 10-ft interfaces with. It's elegant, sneaky, and a very &quot;Apple&quot; thing to do. TV remains TV, OS X remains OS X...you just get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>What would be a real coup? If you could use it with iTunes for Windows...</p>
<p>P.S. If I'm wrong on this one <acronym title="Steve Jobs, who we all know reads this blog">SJ</acronym>, I still think it would be a good one to build.</p>
