<p><a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy</a> wrote up a manifesto and submitted it. Now it's time to <a href="http://www.changethis.com/proposals/314">go vote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Would you like to have a world where the technology that we buy is stable, reliable, and actually serves our needs? In this manifesto, Troy Angrignon has a heart to heart with the purveyors of technology and tells them how, we, the buyers, would like to be treated from now on. And how the community around the technology should be open, transparent, and honest, allowing the technology to accelerate and become more useful more quickly.
