Somewhere on <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/business/20030314/cebit2003_2-06.html">this page</a> (just below the mobo picture) is a picture of a new computer from MSI done up to look almost exactly like a mini-Hi-Fi system receiver.  Very interesting.  A shame to see Apple missing this boat, when it should have been remarkably obvious for them when they came up with the digital Hub concept to take it one step further.
