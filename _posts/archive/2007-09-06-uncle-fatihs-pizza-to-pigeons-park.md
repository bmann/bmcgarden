<p>I had an interesting experience on Wednesday night. The guys at <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">WorkSpace</a> called around some local Gastown businesses to fund a pizza delivery to Pigeon Park, and I stopped in to help hand out the pizzas. Here's a short video that I did with Bill MacEwen talking about why:</p>

<p><a href="http://unclefatihspizza.com/">Uncle Fatih'z Pizza</a> was the project we took on during <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver">BarCamp Vancouver</a> where we built <a href="http://adhack.com/site/comments/diy-advertising-in-60-minutes-or-less/">DIY video advertising in 60 minutes</a>. It was some of the most fun, intense, creative time I had and I would do it again in a second. Here's the video that my team did:</p>

<p>The Pigeon Park experience was great. I don't know <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/08/my-gnomedex-talk-1100-stacies.html">how many Stacies it's worth</a>, but the thanks of the people there who appreciated this food we were giving them was enough. I don't know how we can fix many of the issues faces the Downtown Eastside, but this is Bill's idea to at least spread a little good.</p>
