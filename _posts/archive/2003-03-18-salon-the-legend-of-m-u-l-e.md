What a classic game. I think I played it on the Commodore in high school. I  found it through <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1047968519.html">Ars Technica</a>, but the whole article is <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/18/bunten/index.html">at Salon</a>. It's now being noted as one of the first games that explored social interaction -- the environment changed on the actions of all players, so there was a certain level of co-optition that had to take place.
