<p>OK, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> is on its way and we need to guess what might be announced. Here are some data points:</p><ul><li>a Macbook rev has been announced</li><li>a Macbook Pro rev has been announced</li><li>the iPhone is out and is supercoolawesome already </li><li>we don&#39;t know everything about Leopard</li><li>usually something &quot;cool&quot; gets announced at WWDC</li></ul><p>So, by that logic, we might see something not so exciting like &quot;brushed steel iMacs&quot; (rumor passing on credit to <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a>).</p><p>But, I&#39;m going to take a stab at predicting what we might see: I think we&#39;re in for a 12&quot; Macbook Pro (or a different name?). But with a difference. No keyboard. The entire surface will be a touchpad / tablet / screen thingie, kind of like the iPhone. You can use a virtual keyboard, or you can do crazy touch sensitive actions.</p><p>There are reports of <a href="http://news.com.com/Virtual%20keyboard%20tops%20Apple%20patent%20requests/2100-1041_3-6066425.html">patents</a> going back a while (and yes, that might just be iPhone related), and then there is that crazy virtual keyboard company that I can&#39;t find a link to now, that Apple bought some time ago. </p><p>There. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s my guess. I hope I&#39;m right :P</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I found a <a href="http://www.techfeed.ca/?q=node/95">link to a &quot;leaked&quot; outline for the WWDC keynote</a> tomorrow -- talking about a 10&quot; iPhone at Home...which is pretty close to the &quot;tablet / non computer&quot; that I&#39;ve been thinking Apple would launch for quite some time. </p> <!--break-->
