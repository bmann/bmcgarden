I've been sorely remiss in posting. I'm going to do less commentary in this blog area, and more linking and excerpting -- it is meant to be my "link blog". If you want to be less overwhelmed with new items, try subscribing only to my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/feed" title="B. Mann Consulting RSS Feed - Main page">front page feed</a>. Items for which I provide commentary (hopefully longer, more thoughtful commentary) will go there.

Alternately, you can also choose to only pick the topics that interest you -- see the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/syndication" title="All syndicated feeds at B. Mann Consulting">syndication page</a> for links to all the categories available.
