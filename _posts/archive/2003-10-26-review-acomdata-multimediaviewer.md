<p>I mentioned this device in passing a little while ago, now here is the full review. Kate and I lent our digital camera out after we went to <a href="http://tntjones.bmannconsulting.com">Troy and Tanya's</a> wedding. We kept the full compact flash card, and then decided to get a card reader so we wouldn't have to wait until we got the camera back to see the pictures.</p>

<p>The choice was between a basic Compact Flash card reader and the <a href="http://www.acomdata.com/scripts/products-showdetails.asp?id=65">AcomData MultiMediaViewer</a> (or MMV for short). Read on for the whole story.</p>

<p>$30 will buy you a basic card reader -- a slot for the memory card and a USB cable to plug into your computer. $50 - $60 will buy you a 6-in-1 reader, and perhaps USB 2.0. Or, for about $95, you can get the AcomData MMV.</p>

<p>At it's most basic, it's a card reader that supports reading and writing Compact Flash and Smart Media cards using a USB cable. Most newer operating systems will mount such a card directly on your desktop and treat it like a removable hard drive, without having to install any drivers. This makes it useful for transferring any sort of data, and Compact Flash cards are large enough/cheap enough that you could keep quite a few odds and ends of documents on there.</p>

<p>When we plugged it in to my iMac (it does have a DC power adapter included, but it will draw its power from USB when it's plugged into a computer), the card mounted...and iPhoto recognized it. It never ceases to amaze me what sort of stuff "just works".</p>

<p>Well, it did do some funny stuff when I "ejected" it from the desktop -- the lights (there is a green and red LED on the front) flashed, and then the green went steady and it mounted on the desktop again. This is I expect because it has a mechanical eject button. I guess Mac OS X actually expects stuff to get ejected. I know that when I tried it on Windows XP, you have to do the "stop device" button, and the OS will ignore it until you eject and re-insert the memory card. My "solution" is to hit the manual eject button as soon as the memory card disappears from the desktop.</p>

<p>But what else does it do? Well, thanks to the afore-mentioned DC power adapter (it can also run on four AA batteries) you can listen to MP3s from it. The MMV has an audio-out port that will accept a headphone jack, plus it comes with a cable that splits out into regular RCA jacks for connecting it to your stereo. Evan's consensus was that the sound was a little bass-y, but that may also have been my JVC "Super Bass" headphones.</p>

<p>MP3 playing does have it's drawbacks. When we connected it to Jessie's stereo, it seemed like we had to manually press "next" to listen to the next song -- it wouldn't play them all. I saw some references to playlists being supported, which might fix this, but I haven't tested this yet. Which comes to another downside. The files are played/organized alphabetically by their filename and, since there is no screen or other feedback, your only controls are next, previous, and play/pause/stop.</p>

<p>To get the songs onto the MMV, I copied them over manually from iTunes. I didn't know where to put them, so I just created a folder called "MP3" and dragged them in there. Whatever the "proper" method is, it appears that the MMV scans folders to find MP3 files -- everything just worked.</p>

<p>The second function puts the multi in the MMV's media. It has a video-out port and comes with a standard RCA-style video connector (you know, the yellow kind) so you can plug it into your TV. Yes, you could plug the audio into the TV at the same time.</p>

<p>Using a TV interface (and the included slim IR remote) you can browse through the files on the card. Folders with images can be viewed on screen, where you can press next/previous, or press play to enable a slideshow. Larger images (in this case, the full 1.4MB pictures from our camera at "fine" JPEG quality) took some time to display, first showing a pixelated view, then clearing to show the final images. Also, if images were not oriented correctly, they couldn't be rotated.</p>

<p>Many digital cameras actually have this functionality built-in -- a video out port so that you can do slide shows on a TV. Ours doesn't, so that makes the device even more useful for us: we could take it plus a selection of pictures and show them to people. Kind of the digital equivalent of bringing a photo album over...</p>

<p>Music could also be played using this interface by selecting MP3 files. I didn't have any to test, but movies are also supported, although currently only AVIs using a Motion-JPEG codec. I haven't really looked to see whether there is an easy way for me to create this type of file/codec on my Mac. The box prominently featured notices that downloadable firmware would be made available that enabled MP4 video support. Cool! Nothing on the website yet...</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend this device. It comes with an amazing amount of accessories and abilities, and seems sturdy enough (or rather, it's a plastic shell and a circuit board, and the shell doesn't seem flimsy). If you don't <em>need</em> anything more than a card reader, then this is overkill, but we have nothing other than the computer that will display digital pictures <strong>and</strong> play MP3s. I'll post in comments here when/if firmware gets updated and any other discoveries I make.</p>
