<p>Since I've written about how <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/the-travesty-of-canadian-mobile-data-rates">expensive mobile data plans in Canada are</a>, I should probably praise Rogers for finally getting some sane(r) pricing.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://johnbiehler.com/2008/01/21/shocking-rogers-changes-its-data-plans/">via John Biehler</a> that <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/01/20/rogers-breaks-out-new-data-plans-canadian-jaws-drop/">Engadget had posted rates from Rogers</a> as low as $65 / month for 1GB (recall that in comparison the chart in the previous link which shows 1GB at $4000 / month). Well, as Engadget mentions in the title, my jaw <strong>did</strong> drop, but it quickly snapped shut again when I looked closer and saw that this applies to PC Cards only ... not to the GSM or 3G phones we've been toting around for years.</p>

<p>Per device pricing for data rates seems....well, it seems underhanded if not down right illegal. I wonder what the rules around pricing of telecommunications services have to say about this? Paging <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/">Michael Geist</a>!</p>

<p>Still...this hints that Rogers *could* offer prices like this for, say, the iPhone?</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2cwpx2">TorCamp Swarm on Skype</a> for discussion around this.</p>
