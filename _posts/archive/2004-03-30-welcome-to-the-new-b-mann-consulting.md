It may seem to those that are following along at home that I haven't updated recently. Actually, posting to this "front page" will actually be less frequent, and will be reserved for longer stories.

Read on for full details on the new site.
<!--break-->
The main news is that I've completely split off my personal content into a completely <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com" title="Boris Mann's Personal Site">new site</a>. All the personal content is still on this site, but will eventually get exported.

The blog on this site is going to become, essentially, my link blog -- short pointers and comments that aren't quite long enough for the front page. You can subscribe to the blog separately, using <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/feed/1" title="B. Mann Consulting Link Blog">this link</a>, as opposed to the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/feed" title="B. Mann Consulting Front Page RSS Feed">front page feed</a>.

I will also be making it more clear how to only get feeds for certain categories -- like <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/topics/voip">VoIP</a>, <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/topics/personal-publishing">Personal Publishing</a>, etc.

There are many new features that I am adding, thanks to the newest version of <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. One of the big ones is subscriptions -- if you have an <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/user">account</a>, you can ask to be notified by email whenever a particular post has comments added to it. You can optionally <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/user/edit">edit your user account</a> to be notified by default once you have commented on a post.

Any questions, comments, or feedback, leave them on this post or in the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/discussions/bmc-feedback">site feedback forum</a>.
