<a href="http://www.sxip.org">Sxip</a> came out of hiding today -- " simple, open and trusted identity network". I just signed up for an <a href="http://www.demohomesite.com">account</a> -- not much there yet, but they do have the concept of "personas". Basically, the ability to manage different profiles for different sites you login to.

You'll need that account to watch the <a href="https://sxip.org/Demo">demos</a> -- use a "sxip in" button to login and share requested information from your different personas, instead of having to enter them in all the different places.

This is very similar to what we're thinking about with <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. You can already login to Drupal sites using one home site account. The next step is pushing profile information back and forth (which will likely coincide with some level of FOAF integration).

Will be interesting to look at possible areas of integration.
