The folks over at Snapstream are currently running a giveaway of their new USB remote product, <a href="http://www.snapstream.com/firefly/">Firefly</a>.  They're giving away <a title="SnapStream - Firefly Five for Ten Giveaway" href="http://www.snapstream.com/firefly/giveaway/">five a day for the next ten days</a>. It includes their new home theater PC front-end software, so if you ever wanted to turn your PC into a TiVo, this would be a great way to start.<cite><a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/05/firefly_giveawa.html">PVR Blog: Firefly giveaway</a></cite>

<p>Now that SnapStream has a remote, their software starts to look more interesting. Of course, being layered on top of Windows (both cost and stability issues) makes it less interesting.</p>

<p>I will likely not be playing with this stuff directly for a while, unless I set one up for a friend. Not having a TV kind of makes this area less interesting, and I think a projector is a more likely future purchase.</p>
