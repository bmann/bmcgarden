You know you've always wanted to be a ninja. So why not attend <a href="http://www.entertheninja.com/ninja_school/index.html">Ninja School</a>? Very, very, very funny. Here's a line from the <strong>Ninja Etiquette</strong> section:
<blockquote>
Never show your real face. If you must show a face, it should be a very shiny mask. This is the only possible substitute.
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, once you are a ninja, you will need a proper <a href="http://www.houseofninja.com/wuname.php">ninja name</a>. Mine is &quot;<em>Pissed Tiger</em>&quot;.</p>
