There was some discussion this morning in the office about funny behaviour in Safari, and a report from a website administrator who has apparently tracked packets and discovered that Safari is likely sending information on the software you have on your computer, as well as other information, to Apple.

Apple was starting to get kudos here and there for opposing intrusions into computers and supporting open standards, but if what I've heard is true, then they are not as innocent and angelic as they try so hard to make people believe. Well.... I knew that anyway with many of their dealer policies, pricing policies, and other assorted rubbish.
