We considered building the business around advertising, but&hellip;well, OK, we never really considered that. We&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;consider building it around subscriptions, but under that model, given the option of either developing a feature to increase your sales by 20%, or dinking around with service tiers to try to boost our subscriptions by 20%, we&rsquo;d have to choose the latter. By building the business on a revenue share, our interests are perfectly aligned with yours: we only succeed when you succeed.</blockquote><p>from <a href="http://blog.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/its-a-business-model/">bandcamp.com</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/cbrumelle/status/18556357222">@cbrumelle</a></p><p>This is the post announcing <a href="http://blog.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/its-a-business-model/">Bandcamp&#39;s business model</a> (15% of sales). Bandcamp is the go to solution for putting a band&#39;s music / discography online, and their statement above just makes so much sense: their needs / means of success as a business are 100% aligned with their customers.</p>
