<p>Well, it's Sunday night/Monday morning and I'm still at it. I had a long day today, but a very good meeting with <a href="http://www.eversunsoft.com" title="Eversun Software does J2EE Consulting in Vancouver">Eversun Software</a>. They do software development here in Vancouver, focusing equally on <acronym title="Java 2 Enterprise Edition">J2EE</acronym> and .NET solutions. Now that's what I like to see -- a company with a lot of tools in it's toolbox!</p>

<p>It's been a while since I did hard core Java coding. There's lot's of cool stuff out there, like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> for doing rapid development, and even stuff like <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</a> and <a href="http://avalon.apache.org" title="Modular, Component oriented Programming -- even for desktop apps">Avalon</a> have come a <em>long</em> way. Next thing you know I'll be installing blinds and ordering Jolt Cola by the case-lot. And popping Penguin Caffeinated Mints, natch.</p>

<p>(I don't know what "natch" means -- I threw it in because it seemed appropriate)</p>

<p>I was also IM'ing briefly with <a href="http://michaelday.zerendipity.com" title="Michael Day's Zerendipity Profile">Michael Day</a> just now and realized that I've never compiled all of my "Ãœber-Google Tips and Tricks" anywhere. I've been giving away these tips "for free" for a while now, but it really comes down to implementation. So consider this a little placeholder that will remind me to write this stuff down. Kate would prefer that I get a "real job" :(</p>

<p>I'm working my way through an MS Word doc -- lengthy, lots of formatting and use of styles -- and I suddenly realized that I probably could have done it faster in a <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/" title="Best text editor e-va = SubEthaEdit plus WebKit live Preview of HTML = coding goodness">text editor</a> using HTML and a CSS stylesheet!</p>
