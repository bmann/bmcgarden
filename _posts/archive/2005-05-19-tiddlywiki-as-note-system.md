<p>I don't remember exactly why I looked at <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a> again about a week ago.  I just noticed that <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=e117b1ee-9d33-43d6-9913-e1581344e568">Don Park mentioned it</a>, so I thought I would post before I forgot.</p>

<p>TiddlyWiki is a wiki (sort of) that also happens to be completely self-contained in one HTML file...including being able to edit and save the contents back to disk. It does this through some JavaScript magic, but basically it allows me to have a local copy on my hard drive which I can &quot;run&quot; in my browser. Since it's one file, it could also be copied to a (for example) USB keychain and carried around and run anywhere, on any OS that gives you access to a supported browser, which today means anything that can run Firefox or IE.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> and I are using it to keep our own personal, private notes -- it's our new default home page.</p>

<p>What I love about this use is the lack of context switching. I've been thinking about this a lot lately in the context of computer interaction and interruptions which flow through that space. Switching apps is disruptive, and the app I spend most of my time in is my web browser. With all my notes being only one tab a way, there is no transition into note taking mode or &quot;to do list&quot; mode.</p>

<p>And yes, of course I've been thinking of crazy ideas. TiddlyWiki is an interesting little secret right now. What if we glued it into Drupal? Create a page, and that page is a TiddlyWiki. Every page is an entire wiki, with TiddlyWiki's unique editing/reading style. I'm not quite sure what it would do, but I'm sure it would be interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, and in the best tradition of Steve Jobs, just one more thing: <a href="http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~sonoisa/TiddlyWikiPod/index.html">TiddlyWiki on your iPod</a>...with wiki links to songs, playlists, artists, etc., of course.</p>
