<p>Isn't open source great? Nokia has made the jump to <a href="">using Apple's WebCore and JavaScriptCore framework on its Series 60 platform</a>.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, crazy ideas like have OS X run on phones aside, it means that the widget concept could even be available on Series 60. This might see the creation of another "platform" on top of which to build applications, which runs both on the OS X desktop as well as your mobile phone.</p>
