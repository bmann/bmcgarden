I've just <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/609">put up a post reviewing the Salmon of Doubt</a>, by Douglas Adams. I'm not totally happy with the method I use now, which is to create a "catalog" item which grabs all the info from <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/amazon">Amazon</a>, and then I (or anyone else) can post reviews as comments. But, it is easy, since all the author, title, image, etc. etc. don't need to be manually entered by me -- I just have to find the right ID number, and this works for CDs as well.

After reading the book, I checked out <a href="http://www.h2g2.com" title="Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">h2g2</a> -- it was Adams' idea to create a community where people could put together ideas, reviews, etc. etc. Like many things that Adams thought of, I think this was ahead of its time. It's unfortunate that the BBC hasn't done a great job of running it. I didn't spend much time there, mainly because it was hard to navigate, the layout was confusing, and it seemed slow. Perhaps <a href="http://www.everything2.net">Everything2</a> is more what Adams had in mind? Although it's layout could do with a refresh as well.

Or maybe this mesh of blogs and comments and trackbacks would very much have appealled to Adams. This mesh (along with new search tools, profiles, trust-webs, automatic topics, etc. etc.) seem to be heading towards turning the Internet into a Hitchhiker's Guide. As long as spammers and viagra salesmen don't get there first.
