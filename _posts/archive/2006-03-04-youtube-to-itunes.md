<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could get the original video files back out of <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>? Wouldn't it be great if you could just upload videos to YouTube and have them automatically appear in iTunes, correctly transcoded as needed?</p>  <p>Yes, I was as surprised as you when I went poking around the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/dev">YouTube developer section</a> and found no methods to get back the original video files or to do any of these other things I wish for.</p>  <p>I still like <a href="http://www.revver.com/">Revver's</a> &quot;bolt ads to your videos&quot; business model, and <a href="http://www.audioblog.com">AudioBlog</a> is still my choice for the most flexible commercial service to easily input/host/etc. all your audio and video service (including direct-to-iTunes support).</p>  <p>But where are people putting videos in order to get an audience? YouTube, of course. Let the chorus of &quot;YouTube sucks&quot; begins...until someone else manages to make something that is as popular.</p>
