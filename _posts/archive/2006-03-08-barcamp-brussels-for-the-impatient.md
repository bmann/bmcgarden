<p>So I kind of stealth launched the concept of <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels">BarCamp Brussels</a> in some posts wrapping up FOSDEM 2006, slated for around September 2006 to coincide with EuroOSCON.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: center"><img width="368" height="105" border="0" src="/system/files?file=109839111_d466a8216d.jpg" /></div>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just found out about <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient">BarCamp Brussels ForTheImpatient</a> -- for April/May! Boy, those Europeans sure are impatient :P Being organized by <a href="http://blog.forret.com/blog/index.html">Peter Forret</a>.<br /> </p><p>Hey, <a href="http://www.zylstra.org/blog/">Ton</a>, I'm hoping you and your crew will be interested in one or both camps. What do you think? (and yes, I still &quot;owe&quot; you a post on the 4 jobs meme...it might end up being a podcast or something suitably different).<br /> </p><p>Sounds like fun...wish I could attend lots more European events, but I have to ration out my travel a bit. Hopefully the ForTheImpatient crew will be able to figure out some good areas and set things up nicely for a bigger (or at least...more international?) attendance in September. I'll be watching it with interest.<br /> </p>
