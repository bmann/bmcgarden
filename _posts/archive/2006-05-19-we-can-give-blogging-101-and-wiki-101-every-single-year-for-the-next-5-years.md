<p>Tris writes about <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/blog/_archives/2006/5/18/1968158.html">controversy coming from Debbie Weil</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Somehow I don&#39;t think Debbie intended to start an international firestorm when she came to support me at my <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/blog/_archives/2006/5/15/1959272.html">Mesh Blogging 101 workshop</a>.&nbsp; She <a href="http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/2006/05/tris_hussey_on_.html">posted right away</a> and mentioned that she was surprised some of the questions, that they were similar to the questions we fielded a couple years ago.</p>  <p>I saw that she posted and left a comment.&nbsp; Look I spent most of the day hanging out with Debbie including post-conference dinner, she really, really didn&#39;t mean it like it came out.&nbsp; She edited that post and <a href="http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/2006/05/i_take_it_all_b.html">came out with another soon after</a>.</p>  <p>All of this <a href="http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2006/05/canadian_fighti.html">got the attention of BusinessWeek&#39;s Blogspotting blog</a>, oh dear.</p> </blockquote>  <p>One of the phrases <a href="http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/2006/05/tris_hussey_on_.html">from Debbie</a> was &quot;Interesting, though, that they&#39;re such close neighbors and yet the &quot;mind set&quot; and knowledge level about blogging is a beat or two behind.&quot;. So, I was *at* most of the blogging conferences in the US two years ago. Specifically, early 2004, <a href="http://www.willpate.org">Will Pate</a> and I and a ton of other Canadian folks descended on the Business Blogging Conference in Seattle. I seem to remember Debbie saying a rather naive comment at the time...</p>  <p>In any case, blogging and wikis are not mainstream in Corporate North America. I don&#39;t know how long it will take, but I suspect we can give Blogging 101 and Wiki 101 courses for the next 5 years at least. At this point, these tools can be a real competitive advantage if companies invest in learning about them now.</p><p><a href="http://www.meshconference.com">Mesh</a> was good. In part (I&#39;ll admit it) surprisingly so. The organizers did a great job of mixing the tribes, and I think both sides benefited from it.&nbsp;</p>
