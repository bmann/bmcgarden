<blockquote>A reader of this blog anonymously posted a comment to one of my earlier posts, <a href="http://tedshelton.blogspot.com/2004/05/how-cheap-can-it-get.html">How Cheap Can It Get?</a>, asking if the price to make a phone call might one day drop to zero.  The answer is YES and that day is already here.
