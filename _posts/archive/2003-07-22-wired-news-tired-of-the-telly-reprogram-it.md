Over at <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59690,00.html">Wired News</a> is this story about what some are calling an "open-source PVR":
<blockquote>A Colorado startup, Interact-TV, has released a hacker-friendly digital entertainment center that plays, records and archives TV shows, DVDs, music and even digital photo albums.  

The Telly MC1000 Digital Entertainment Center, available now from the company's <a href="http://www.interact-tv.com/">website</a> for $900, can also surf the Web and act as a home media server.</blockquote>via <a href="http://boingboing.net/#200443735">Boing Boing</a>

Looks like a great, Linux-based device. Looking at all the different options for video capture, photo storage, etc. etc. I was already getting a headache at the thought of putting one of these things together and supporting it long term. I don't mind paying a reasonable price and having access to a community which is working on advancing the platform.
