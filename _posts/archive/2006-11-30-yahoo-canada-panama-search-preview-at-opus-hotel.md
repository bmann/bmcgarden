<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/311462177/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/102/311462177_5c45a10b61_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></a>I&#39;m currently at a <a href="http://ca.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Canada</a> preview event at the Opus Hotel. I&#39;m actually skipping out on the  <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/vancouver">Vancouver Drupal User Group</a> because it&#39;s taking longer than I expected (sorry, guys!).</p><p>Yahoo! is going to be focusing heavily on the Canadian market. I&#39;ve long been convinced that focusing on the Canadian market is a great strategy. Obviously, it&#39;s not as large as the US market, but the &#39;search density&#39; is very low: it&#39;s very easy to get top ranks for keywords that include Canadian place names.</p><p>Yahoo! Canada has grown from 12 people to over 100. Of course, most of those are based out east: there is a small sales ofice here in Vancouver. Next goal (for me): get an R&amp;D lab in Vancouver. Of course, I still know more people out of SF Yahoo than here in Canada: most of the focus here is on sales rather than technology. </p><p>The Panama Search advertising demo was very interesting. Most of the presentation was focused on ad purchasers, rather than inventory providers. It seems to have a much more robust dashboard and great geo-location capabilities, visualization, analytics, etc. -- they actually mentioned 13 provinces and territories.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t hurt that 80% of Canadian Internet users use a Yahoo property of some kind... <br /></p><p>I was the only one to ask a question (surprise!) after the pure presentation part of the event. I asked about inventory: what was Yahoo!&#39;s strategy to get more Yahoo! ads onto various Canadian web properties? The answer was very much focused on partnerships with &quot;main stream&quot; providers. Rogers was the name mentioned (not sure if that is mobile or cable data or...?). I was fishing for an answer about how to get developers and bloggers in Canada to bake Yahoo-related content and ads into their stuff.</p><p>I did catch up with Kerry Munro, the GM of Yahoo! Canada afterwards, and I&#39;m satisfied that they have a real strategy and the people in place to follow it up. Still: it&#39;s catch up time to convince both ad buyers and &quot;inventory&quot; of content providers to use Yahoo instead of &quot;the other guys&quot;.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/311463919/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/120/311463919_82706e6da0_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></a></p><p>Note to <a href="http://www.fleishman.ca/en/">Fleishman-Hillard</a>: you need more west coast presence -- you missed a bunch of folks like <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren Barefoot</a> who are big out here, never mind a potential huge customer like Markus at <a href="http://www.plentyoffish.com">plentyoffish.com</a> (blog at <a href="http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com">plentyoffish.wordpress.com</a>). Thanks in any case for getting me in last minute :P<br /> </p><p>Here&#39;s a link to a <a href="http://www.traffick.com/2006/11/after-panama-in-canada-launch-two.asp">review of the Toronto version of the same event</a>, with another one by <a href="http://stuart.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/11/29/2535648.html">Stuart McDonald</a> of Mesh-y fame.</p><p>Photos by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/">KK</a>, of course.&nbsp;</p>
