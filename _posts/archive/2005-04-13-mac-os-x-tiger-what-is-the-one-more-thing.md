<p>By now we've heard about Apple's upcoming release of Mac OS X 10.4, a.k.a. Tiger. It's scheduled for the end of this month: April 29th.</p>
<p>And all of the features are known. <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/007715.html">Michael Gartenberg gushes</a> about the release, saying he's &quot;still convinced that Tiger is a big deal and it just might be the the best OS on a PC I have ever seen for productivity use&quot;.</p>
<p>But we've come to expect something more. Jobs always seems to have a rabbit up his sleeve. Or maybe the new OS really is that good, that installing it/using it IS the rabbit? I can tell people are looking for more info -- my <a href="/node/1009">rumours post on 10.4 is getting lots of traffic</a>.</p>
<p>Here's my related but somewhat random rumour: <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a> has been talking Apple a lot lately. Jobs has convinced him to come to Apple to do tablet evangelism (that's the one more thing, and here's my <a href="/node/1441">Mac tablet spec</a>) and kickstart Apple's entry into the blogosphere.</p>

<p>What do you think? What are you most looking forward to in Tiger?</p>
