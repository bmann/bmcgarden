	Having completed my move and gotten a little breathing room, I&#39;ve decided to schedule the Batchbook intro / user group sharing session for Tuesday, June 15th, for 6pm at the Bootup Labs offices.</p>
<p>
	Batchbook is a social CRM tool useful for managing contacts, deal flow, sales leads, and many other things related to people and companies.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m a big fan of the tool, and will be explaining how *I* use it, and some of its major features. It&#39;s in a similar space as <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">37Signals&#39; Highrise</a>, and is probably a better choice for smaller / web based organizations than the big daddy <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re an existing user of Batchbook, please come and share your experiences - for example, a particular way that it fits in your workflow, some of your custom SuperTags, etc.</p>
<p>
