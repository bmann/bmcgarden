title: MS Access - Why the need for Visual Basic?

I am wondering why Microsoft would make their MS Access need the programming skills of Visual Basic to perform, seemingly, a simple function?

I had my tracking database set-up in MS Excel but wanted more functionality and an input page (forms), for ease of use, but the simple task of subtracting one DATE from another DATE (something easily possible within Excel) is some drawn-out VB script.

Is there an easier way?
