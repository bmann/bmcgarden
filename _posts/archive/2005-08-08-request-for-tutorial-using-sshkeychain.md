<p>Richard <a href="http://www.undeniablygeeky.com/weblog/2005/08/08/10">wrote about securing his email</a> with SSHKeyChain in the context of pointing to <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2005/08/07/oscon-2005-wireless-sniffing/">Kees Cook's discovery of 45 clear auth POP accounts at OSCON</a>.</p>

<p>I actually ran <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/">SSHKeyChain</a> before my upgrade to Mac OS X Tiger, but never re-installed. It worked most of the time, but not all the time. To be honest, the whole process is somewhat hard. Richard (or anyone), I'm making a Request for Tutorial (RFT): please document both the requirements (what do I need in a mail server to support this?) and the steps involved in secure email.</p>
