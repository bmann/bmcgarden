I came across an <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/04/21/HNsonytoshiba_1.html">interesting article</a> about the fab for the next-gen Sony Playstation chip.  I wonder if this fab will exclusively produce Sony PS3 chips, or the support and related chips as well.

Interesting to note - the team plans on making the PS3 chip the first 1 teraflop chip for a consumer product.  That's a lot of power.  I wonder if Apple may some day look at this as the future of Apple's own CPU line, minus the ability to emulate the PS3 system.

Whatever the case, the console gaming world is beginning to look a lot more exciting than the computer world in terms of how radically it advances the performance curve.

But will game development and <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/doom.html">graphics</a> be able to catch up and utilize all that extra performance?
