	I&#39;m going to be on <a href="http://www.ctv.ca">CTV Newsnet</a> again, this afternoon at 3:15PM PST, live with Marcia MacMillan. Below are a few notes and links, I&#39;ll clean this up and post a link to the clip once it&#39;s wrapped. I <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/rogers-bringing-iphone-canada-ctv-newsnet-edition">talked about the iPhone last time</a>, and somehow I think it&#39;s going to come up again.</p>
<p>
	in fact, Rogers is the only firm NOT charging for incoming texts, they now have a decent data plan, they have the high end Nokia phones, AND they have the iPhone.</p>
<p>
	Only North America charges for incoming text messages -- Europe and Asia have always been free.</p>
<p>
	via <a href="http://www.ianbell.com/2008/07/08/more-canadian-wireless-carrier-greed/">Ian Bell</a> - http://www.physorg.com/news129793047.html - &quot;SMS costs are, in the aggregate, 4x higher than getting data from the Hubble space telescope. Global SMS revenues are larger than the Hollywood movie, music and video game industries combined.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Lots more from Ian, like &quot;I could personally store-and-forward all of Canada&rsquo;s SMS traffic myself via my Novus broadband in Yaletown, and it would have limited impact on my BitTorrenting&quot;. Oh, right, and of course the fact that SMS effectively is NO extra load on carriers - &quot;As such it costs the network exactly nothing and uses no bandwidth that isn&rsquo;t already in use &mdash; traffic load is the same on the network even if no SMS messages are being transferred.&quot; - http://www.kenneyjacob.com/2007/06/19/how-sms-works/</p>

<p>
	Bell and Telus being called before Jim Prentice, Minister of Industry - http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/07/bell_telus_called_before_federal_industry_minister.html - of course, I&#39;m going to mention C-61 and cellphone locking that Mr. Prentice has a hand in</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update:</strong> I was off at a photowalk this evening and am just getting back. My segment was quite short, but I&#39;m glad I got a C-61 mention in. Thanks to <a href="http://johnbiehler.com">Mr. iPhone John Biehler</a> for digging up the direct link to my clip: http://watch.ctv.ca/news/latest/text-charges/#clip65669</p>
