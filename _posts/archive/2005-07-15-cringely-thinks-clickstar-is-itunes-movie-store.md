<p>Actually, Cringely <em>also</em> thinks that Apple is going to come out with a portable retinal display:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about a higher resolution display, possibly a retinal scan display, for the Video iPod? It's the only way to extend Apple's "Year of HD" to its tiniest platform.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the retinal scan patents are held by Bothell, Washington-based MicroVision, a company I have written about in the past. And from the look of the SEC filings, a lot is happening up there in Bothell. As always I have no insider information at all, but it wouldn't surprise me if Apple introduced a super-high-capacity iPod and a separate retinal-scan display. It will be aimed at the very high end of the price scale, just like the Apple Cinema Display originally cost $4,000 for what now costs less than $1,000. The retinal scan display won't be cheap, but it will be cool, and it will be some permutation of HD, too.</p>

<p>Cringely spends some time talking about how Intel is tied into movies here, through its investment in Click Star. Retinal displays? I don't know. I still want a <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1424">Mac tablet</a>, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was Intel-powered.</p>
