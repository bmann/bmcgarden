<blockquote>
I would personally like to see a public debate on SIP versus Skype with myself and Niklas on the panel and put the theories in front of the people. If nothing else it might educate a few people.

<p>Recounting his experiences at VON Canada, Erik Lagerway wants to take on Skype.</p>

<p>How's that for sensationalism? Actually, I very much agree with what Erik has to say in his post: we've already travelled down the road of incompatible networks in the IM world, why would we want to do the same thing with Skype? And it's still Windows only, with APIs only for the COM world. What happens the first time you want to call a Mac- or Linux-user?</p>
