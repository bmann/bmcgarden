<p>Wow...been a while since I commented on VoIP. I had been testing a service from <a href="http://www.unlimitel.ca" title="Business VoIP for Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto">Unlimitel</a>, helping check on cross-country latency. It worked very well (much better quality than Talkbroadband), although their VoIP router was a pain to set up. I especially enjoyed the voicemail-via-email feature. I'm done with testing, and since they only currently offer numbers for Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto, I'm shipping the system back (note to Stephan: I haven't gotten around to getting it packaged up yet, will try to get to that this week).</p>

<p>In any case, this comment from anonymous user "Daniel":</p>
<blockquote>
Hello: Has anyone tried Yak's new VoIP product? I just saw their ad in the Toronto edition of the Metro and their packages begin at $12.99 a month. Any feedback would be appreciated.

<p>See what I dug up in the full post.</p>

<p>I looked around a bit, and didn't find any first hand reports of people using Yak. I also couldn't find information on what equipment they are using. I did find <a href="http://worldcity.yak.com/frame.cgi?http%3A//worldcity.yak.com/en/availability/%3FCountry_columnfilter%3DCAN" title="Yak Canadian VoIP Area Codes">this list of area codes available in Canada</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://worldcity.yak.com/frame.cgi?http%3A//worldcity.yak.com/en/features/">features page</a> has a few more details. It looks like the Yak "VoIP Caller" product is mainly for <em>making</em> calls, with limited features -- at $9.99USD, this is probably the Canadian product.</p>

<p>The "VoIP Communicator" is the full-featured product, and you can apparently get numbers in the US, Canada, or the UK, and even get a second number (at additional charge). At $14.99USD a month, that's the one I would pick. Even has voicemail-via-email, although they call it unified messaging. Can't tell if the softphone (either XTen Pro and/or XTen's Eyebeam) is an extra cost or not.</p>

<p>Hmmm...I initially scoffed at Yak (silly name, look to be aiming downmarket), but it might be worth a try. Before February 28th, looks like no install charge, either. Put your own comments on Yak or anything else VoIP-related in the <a href="/forums/voip">VoIP forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did find out what equipment they are using, and it looks good! That is, checking out the <a href="http://worldcity.yak.com/assets/en/user_manual/IM_Overview_1.1.pdf">installation manual overview (PDF)</a>, the pictures look like the same box that I currently have from Unlimitel -- the Mediatrix 2102. This unit can be (as I mentioned at the start) a bit of a pain to configure. Specifically, it <strong>does not</strong> support NAT, so you have to install it between your broadband modem and your router. This will also screw up things like iChat, although Skype works great.</p>

<p>The good news is that voice quality is excellent, although that may have as much to do with Unlimitel's network.</p>
