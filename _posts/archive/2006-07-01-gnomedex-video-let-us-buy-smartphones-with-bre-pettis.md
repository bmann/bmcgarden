<p>I&#39;ve now got ShoZu on my Nokia 6630 setup to easily send video to <a href="http://bmann.blip.tv">my blip.tv account</a>*. Lots of <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> video going up.</p>  <p>Most fun was lamenting about the lack of Nokia smartphones to buy here in North America with <a href="http://brepettis.com/">Bre Pettis</a> (someone *needs* to give Bre a phone for his <a href="http://phonetagger.com/">Phonetagger</a> alter-ego) and <a href="http://www.willpate.org">Will Pate</a>. Short story here is: Nokia, forget about <a href="/blog/bmann/matchstick-ca-is-buzz-marketing-gone-wrong" title="Matchstick.ca is buzz marketing in Canada gone wrong">buzz marketing</a> to give away phones -- there are people that just want to *buy* your high end phones.</p><p>  	 	<a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Bmann-BreLoveHatesNokia403.3gp?source=3"><img src="http://blip.tv/uploadedFiles/Bmann-BreLoveHatesNokia403-902.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> 	<br /> 	<br /> 	<a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Bmann-BreLoveHatesNokia403.3gp?source=3">Watch the Video </a></p><p>And I&#39;m going to repeat what I said to Nokia before about encouraging carriers (especially in Canada):</p><blockquote><p>My top hint on what Nokia should do? Forget the free phones: continue to sell great phones, but pressure Fido and Rogers to offer a &quot;citizen journalism&quot; data package so people in Canada can use all the cool features. The HipTop plan from Fido is $25/month for unlimited data...I think there would be a ton of people that would pay that to be able to upload pictures to Flickr on the fly and use all of the other great features that Nokia phones can enable (*cough* <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">ShoZu</a> *cough*). <br /></p></blockquote><p>* Micki: I&#39;ve been talking about <a href="http://www.revver.com">Revver.com</a> a lot. blip right now is just so damn easy to put this low quality camphone video up to. I know I can make money on Revver, but I need it to be a little easier to use.&nbsp;</p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Bmann-BreLoveHatesNokia403.3gp?source=3"></a>
