<p><a href="http://www.meshconference.com"><img width="178" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="158" border="0" align="left" src="/system/files?file=Picture%204.png" /></a>Looks like <a href="http://www.meshconference.com">Mesh Conference</a> was just announced -- a &quot;Web 2.0&quot; conference for Canada. At $350 for 2 days, I have to think about this vs. <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a>. Of course, those are Canadian pesos, so lots less. Many interesting faces, but not a lot of details on tracks, conference style, etc. The blurb from one of the first blog posts goes like this:</p><blockquote><p>There is all this buzz around Web 2.0. But what&rsquo;s really happening, especially around here? Does anybody know? Can anybody help me understand it, and what it means for me? My business? My future? My family? My world?<br /><br />mesh&rsquo;s mandate will be to answer this question in as compelling, credible and authentic a way possible. Everything to do with the event will be around furthering that objective, and the content itself will serve to help mesh participants (not attendees :-)) to really start to get it, this year and in years to come. We will create the Canadian forum for next generation Web ideas and leaders. <br /></p></blockquote><p>Here's the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/65428/">upcoming.org link</a> -- nice to see <a href="http://www.walkah.net">walkah</a> and I were among the first two to start tracking it. I'm watching for now: would like to support other Canadian events, but suspect it might just be a chance to <strike>party</strike> <strike>connect</strike> party with a bunch of folks from south of the border. Well, either that, or we storm the place with a troop of West Coast folks (just like Gnomedex...).</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: I completely forgot about everyone's favourite unconference that is happening right before Mesh -- <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCamp">BarCamp TDot</a>. Here's the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/65436/">upcoming.org link</a> for that.&nbsp;</p><p>Mesh guys: post a logo/badges -- I had to screenshot the one I have here to post it since it's not a separate image. (Rob Hyndman emailed me the logo -- it's attached below -- they'll likely post it to their blog soon)<br /></p>
