Don&#39;t forget the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/relationship">Relationship module</a> -- it&#39;s still around and still very interesting. RDF for a long time has had the perception of complexity. Secondly, it has had real performance issues as tuples can&#39;t natively be represented in a relational database. Both of these are chicken-and-egg issues, I believe. If there were more running code in an easily accessible platform that automatically created and worked with RDF metadata...well, we might see some interesting things :P</li> <li><a href="http://mixel.be">Mixel</a> and Ton should meet/talk more. Mixel&#39;s <a href="http://www.knosos.be/">KNOSOS (Knowledge Sharing over Social Software)</a> project has built some very interesting tools on top of Drupal and is continuing to evolve; we&#39;re all looking forward to see more on his tag visualization</li> </ul>  <p>Ton uses <a href="http://www.qumana.com">Qumana</a> to easily cross-post to multiple locations. I&#39;m unhappy with this as a solution, as context is actually lost. That is, there should be one canonical/permanent/referenceable URI for each blog post...or at least a GUID. Atom does this well, we need it to be better automated. To be fair, Ton does customize and/or intro each duplicated cross post, adding local context. Ideally, there is a field in the feed specs that could be used for this purpose without changing the GUID -- I may want to see his local context hints, but I don&#39;t want to see the same article three times from him. I know I feel the same pressure/need -- these collection of posts should be at Bryght as well as B. Mann Consulting because we haven&#39;t yet enabled automatic aggregation of targetted posts.</p>  <p>Corporate use of aggregated/group blogs may be pointing towards more of a focus on feed reading via person. Or are also trying to solve the cross-posting issue mentioned above.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.flock.com/blog">Flock</a> actually wrote the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/planet">Planet module</a> for Drupal to help in aggregating employee blogs. Not only that, it is easy to indicate which posts should actually be cross-posted by the use of keyword filtering.</li> <li><a href="http://www.socialtext.com/blog/">SocialText</a> uses the built-in multi-user community blog feature of Drupal -- they don&#39;t currently aggregate. This is an out-of-the-box Drupal functionality -- there are feeds available by author (all multi-author systems SHOULD have this...I&#39;m again reminded of this crazy mixed feed from the <a href="http://gigaom.com">Om gang</a> that still continues to annoy me) as well as the aggregate feed.</li> </ul> <p>I only know of these corporate examples because they use Drupal. Pointers to other examples appreciated...ideally NOT using the <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet Planet</a> code, but something integrated directly into the corporate site.</p>  <p>We were discussing upcoming conference schedules for the next 6 - 8 months. Ton knows a fellow Drupal compatriot, <a href="http://www.langemark.com/">Gunnar Langemark</a>, because of his attendance at <a href="http://reboot.dk/">REBOOT</a>. It sounds like a conference I should make time for (and I&#39;ve been meaning to). But conferences planning now needs to take place *globally* -- the <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/news/2006/06/30/go-to-lift-then-join-us-at-northern-voice-07">LIFT conference wanting to know the Northern Voice schedule</a> indicates as well that we digital nomads are not geographically restricted. But we are still restricted by space and time to only be in one place at a time :P</p>
