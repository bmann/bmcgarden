<blockquote>
	I see a trend there. The bleeding edge of the Web has moved away from HTML and onto other fronts -- fronts where the standards bodies have not yet been involved. <cite><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/11.html#a7733">The Scobleizer: Molly calls for Web standards advocates to hold strong</a></cite></blockquote>

	Bleeding edge is really well done Flash or other more &quot;active&quot; technologies: XAML, XUL, Java Webstart. Does this mean you have to ignore standards? Definitely not, but here it&#39;s more about interfaces (XML-RPC, SOAP, platform APIs) than formats (XHTML etc.).</p>
