<p><a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/drupal-python#comment-136984">BrendonC dropped by to leave a comment</a> mentioning that Drupal in Python -- aka <a href="http://drupy.net/">Drupy</a> -- is a real project.</p>

<p>Here's the latest update (as of 6/17/2008):</p>

<blockquote>
Currently, Drupy can successfully run Drupal Bootstrap Phase 8. This means there is one more Drupal Bootstrap phase to be completed before alpha completion. For more details, check the <a href="http://drupy.net/status/current.html">Drupy diagnostic page</a>, which is updated regularily.
</blockquote>

<p>Find the <a href="http://gitorious.org/projects/drupy/repos/mainline">code on Gitorius</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/drupy">news and bugtracking on Sourceforge</a>, and say 'hi' on freenode at #drupy.</p>
