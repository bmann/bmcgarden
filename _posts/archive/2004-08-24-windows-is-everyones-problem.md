<p>Talking about malware/spyware on Windows, Robert Scoble says <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/23.html#a8138">the problem is horrific out there</a>. Luckily, Scoble is someone that is passionate about fixing this.</p>

<p>I'm realistic -- most of the world runs Windows. But for my immediate business contacts, friends, and family, I have a pretty clear line: if you want my help, get a Mac. Part of this is because I no longer run Windows anywhere. And this is problematic -- I don't see what's happening on the other side of the fence, I'm not exposed to a wider range of ideas, and I certainly don't keep up with all the ins and outs of security and support issues like I used to.</p>

<p>The whole technology/computer industry could get a lot farther ahead with some of these issues behind us.</p>
