<p>Whoops! I was answering a different set of requirements (specifically, Blackberry vs. Treo as the only two choices) and <a href="http://www.alexandrasamuel.com">Alex</a> picked a Treo. She actually mentioned it on the phone again today, and I still didn't get that she was talking about *my* post as the impetus for her switch...</p>

<p>From the universe of all smart phone/PDA choices, I'm currently liking the Nokia/Symbian Series60 platform. I also quite liked my Sony Ericsson, and the P910 is a pretty good device. The Palm is still an open platform, and my main point is to go unlocked and open, whatever device you choose.</p>

	<p>The other tool that <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com">Boris Mann</a> points me to is <a href="http://www.objective-decision.com/en/products/od4contact/">OD4Contact</a>. Since Boris’ offhand <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1499">post re: buying an unlocked Treo</a> is what tipped me over the Treo-purchase abyss, I’m inclined to follow-up on any tool that he tells me actually will make my life easier. I’m downloading it now — report to follow.

<p>My friend Jamie ended up getting a Blackberry, and I had a chance to play with it a bit this weekend. It has Bluetooth, but apparently only supports it as an audio interface -- we got it connected to my Nokia 6630, but only as an Audio Gateway. I tried to send vCards, photos, anything -- and nothing worked. What a waste -- it's email crack and nothing but. Call me back when you've built an open developer community.</p>

<p>And Alex: sorry to have pushed you over the abyss. I used Entourage extensively several years ago, but after the Nth database corruption of its proprietary system, I vowed not to play the lock-in game again. Mail, Address Book, and iCal are certainly not perfect, but they expose their data in open (enough) formats and interfaces that other tools can be built around them.</p>
