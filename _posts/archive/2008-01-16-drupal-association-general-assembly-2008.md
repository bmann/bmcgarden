<p>As of yesterday, January 15th, 2008, the <a href="http://association.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a> had its first General Assembly. The Board of Directors (aside from the President and Treasurer -- these are two year positions) was dissolved and 11 new Permanent Members were elected from a <a href="http://buytaert.net/applications/applications">slate of almost 60 applications</a>. The combined set of now 25 Permanent Members then elected new Board Members -- see the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about/staff">Association staff page</a> for details.</p>

<p>This is a good thing.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing how this new, larger Association evolves and settles into a working relationship. I fully expect the amount of work to expand to fill everyone's time :P</p>

<p>My main piece of feedback for all applicants and community members is that being a Permanent Member just means more work. There is nothing blocking you from contributing -- especially in "non code" ways -- today. <a href="http://groups.drupal.org">Groups.Drupal.org</a> is an easy, friendly place to start posting ideas and asking for feedback, and the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-marketing">Drupal Marketing</a> group in particular needs more participants.</p>

<p>And Dries, in his usual sneaky way, managed to coordinate things so that the second year of the Drupal Association also marks <a href="http://buytaert.net/happy-seventh-birthday-drupal">Drupal's 7th birthday</a>. Happy birthday, Drupal, and congratulations to all the new members of the Association. As always, Drupal World Domination :P</p>
