<p>In the office today, we talked more <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. It&#39;s an important component of the industry we play in.</p><p>Here&#39;s a little analogy that we think is right:</p><blockquote><p>Facebook is to the Internet as the <a href="http://www.mallofamerica.com/">Mall of America</a> is to the rest of the world: there are a lot of people, activity and commerce on the inside, and you definitely want a stall/shop/exhibit there, but your warehouse, your home base, is always going to be on the outside.</p></blockquote><p>Sure is fun thinking about how all these things intertwingle....Â </p>
