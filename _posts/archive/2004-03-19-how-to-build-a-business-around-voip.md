<p>Along with the continued excitement around VoIP, <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/add/story">GigaOm has posted his "Beware the VoIP Hype"</a> article. There is belief that the scramble to invest is creating another bubble, with comparisons being drawn to the investment in DSL providers.</p>

<p>I believe the bubble around <em>residential</em> VoIP is just that -- a bubble. But there is a need for business-focused VoIP expertise and services.</p>

<p>I don't see a bubble there, and I still see a lack of companies addressing the space (especially in Canada). Mainly because it's not technology that's lacking (there are many proprietary and open-source solutions), but rather knowledgeable, independent VoIP consultants. There is a lack of such people that know how to implement VoIP solutions for small and medium businesses. Read on for my idea of how to build a business around this.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>A successful VoIP-related company could be built around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing turn-key solutions to independent consultants, including technical and marketing assistance, a knowledge base, etc.</li>
<li>Running and maintaining VoIP gateways at different POPs</li>
<li>Give consultants a piece of the ongoing service revenue</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a model provides independent computer and telephony consultants (and even small ISPs) a way forward: a way to quickly start offering VoIP services without having to have all the expertise in-house. They get all the money for installations and on-site support with the assurance of having a third-level technical support entity that they can turn to if they themselves need help. With a piece of any ongoing revenues, they gain a new revenue stream.</p>

<p>Note: I've been thinking about this concept for a while -- this is the first that I've written publicly about it. As always, implementation is everything. Have a couple of hundred thousand to steer my way or want to team up to attack different geographic markets? <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/feedback">Contact me</a>.</p>
