Bob Cringely updates his site with more colours and a bigger, more personal picture.

Boris updates his own website, adding more colours and a picture that doesn't include industry figureheads beside it, although it does look a lot like something Tom Cruise might look like.

Is there a connection?  Is Boris turning into a mad prophet of the web?

Speaking of mad prophets of information mediums, I came across the movie Network recently, and absolutely loved it.  It's a 10 out of 10 for renting, absolutely hilarious and scathing criticism of news media back in the 70s, and things have only gotten worse in the news media since.
