<p>Next Thursday, September 13th would be slightly less than 6 weeks after BarCamp Vancouver...but would keep things rolling.</p>

<p>What say you? Should we go ahead and roll with something ad hoc next week, or wait until October 4th? Leave a comment! Make a blog post! Suggest a topic/speaker/demo!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Oct. 4th it is, check Facebook for the event listing that just got sent out, and I've just copy/pasted the wiki page: <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver03">DemoCampVancouver03</a>. Coming up right before that is <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/events/event49801.html">Launch Party</a> -- but I'll do a longer post on that as I get more info on it.</p>
