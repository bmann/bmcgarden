<p>What I've learned - and relearned with every conference and event I attend - is that every event is what you make of it. You are there, and you can participate. Nothing says you have to sit in the audience - get outside and network in the &quot;lobbycon&quot;. Most especially with unconferences, the people that are there are those that make the event.</p>
<p>I'm one of the <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2009">BarCamp Vancouver 2009</a> volunteers this year. Yes, you read that right: <em>volunteers</em>. In Vancouver, this has always been a community, grass roots event. You'll see some of the same names and faces involved with other events, but every year you'll also see new people that step up and GSD.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infil00p.org/blog/?p=294">Joe is grumpy</a> that we don't have more makers presenting. I would LOVE&nbsp;to see more makers. And I hope everyone with connections to makers encourages them to attend and present and share and make the entire community richer for it.</p>
<p>Here's the comment that I left on Joe's post:</p>

<p>Blatant shilling? That would get you yanked off stage.<br />
<br />
1) It was $20 last year &mdash; it just got paid at the door and caused untold amounts of work. And this year it includes coffee AND lunch AND the party (last year, party only, no food).<br />
<br />
Anyone that has issues with paying can get a pass.<br />
<br />
2) Last year&rsquo;s sessions reflect who came and wanted to talk. Bring other people to talk about different things if you want different topics.<br />
<br />
3) I don&rsquo;t understand the not paying comment. You paid last year?<br />
<br />
I would much rather keep *Camp inclusive, rather than further splinter our community.<br />
<br />
Get in touch borismann AT gmail.com &mdash; I&rsquo;d love to have you come to the next meeting, or just give kick ass presentations.<br />
<br />
P.S. I&rsquo;m going to be participating in sessions on food and food policy. Because that&rsquo;s what I care about. Remember, the people that are at BarCamp is what shape it: so bring more people and talk about what YOU want to talk about.</p>
