I've now installed a notification module for this website. While logged in, you can go to <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/notify">the notify section</a> and enable it. It's currently set to send notifications once per day <strong>if</strong> there's new content. There's a new "notification" tab at the upper left.

Hopefully Evan is reading this and will go <a href="http://drupal.org/project/notify">install the notify.module</a> as well. The feature I like is comments. New items are handled great by RSS, but since they don't include comments, I always have to remember to go back and check items to see if someone posts a reply to my comments.

Now for the plus...<!--break-->

I have a second Drupal site. Actually, I have a bunch more. For starters, there's <a href="http://rpg.bmannconsulting.com" title="RPG -- Now even geekier">RPG</a> -- role playing games, video games, etc. As if there wasn't enough geek-technical stuff, now you can go check out geek-gaming stuff too (yes, I'm trying to separate worlds a little bit). See, Lloyd, I didn't even post <strong>this</strong> item to the front page!

As for other Drupal sites...well, did I mention that Kate and I are getting married? Yup, we basically "decided" it was time. And yes, <a href="http://wedding.bmannconsulting.com" title="Boris and Kate's Wedding Site">there is a wedding site</a>. The date is August 1, 2004.

Once that news has sunk in, you can also go visit my <a href="http://drupal-cvs.bmannconsulting.com" title="Boris' Drupal Development Site">Drupal CVS site</a>. Basically I'm doing all my development there, and have test pages, and live development going on there.

And I should probably mention that I switched our <a href="http://www.phenomenalsolutions.com" title="Phenomenal Solutions - IT, Web Development, and Business Consulting">work site</a> over to Drupal as well. Commenting is turned off on most things except for some of the how-tos and the news items, so it's much more like a static site. Except of course that we can add/edit things to our hearts content. Not quite finished yet -- the design/layout needs a bit of a face lift -- but I'm much happier with this one than any of the other ones (v3, if you're keeping track).
