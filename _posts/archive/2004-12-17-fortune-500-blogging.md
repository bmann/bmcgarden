<p><a href="/www.ensight.org">Jeremy C. Wright</a> posted this in the comments to <a href="http://www.businessblogconsulting.com/2004/12/business_blog_c_1.html">Rick E. Bruner's post about blog consulting companies</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Rick, InsideBlogging is an exclusive blog consulting company, it's all we do. We've only been around for a few weeks, but we're just about to announce our 5th client - a Fortune 500 company.

<p>I know <a title="Darren Barefoot, Vancouver Blogfather" href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a>, Jeremy's partner in <a title="Inside Blogging" href="http://www.insideblogging.com">Inside Blogging</a>, which they started specifically to be a blog consulting company.</p>

<p>I look back at the year 2004 and shake my head in wonder. (note how I still file this under the term &quot;personal publishing&quot; and try and stay away from the &quot;b&quot; word).</p>
