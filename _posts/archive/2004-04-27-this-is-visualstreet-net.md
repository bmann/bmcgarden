Imagine a web site that holds photographs of every street number in London. Each picture would be uploaded by the general public using camphones. The system would hold a history of photos. It would be searchable by postcode or street name and street number in the style of Streetmap.co.uk. Attached to each photo would be a Wiki style page where people could leave comments and reviews. When you're going somewhere new, you could get a map from streetmap and visit this site to see what #23 actually looks like. If you were using a Wifi or GPRS connected PDA, you could look at the reviews and pictures while deciding whether to go in.

<p><a href="http://www.visualstreet.net">VS</a> is in a holding pattern. It's likely that some of the functionality will end up getting integrated into <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com" title="Urban Vancouver - Local news powered by people">UrbanVancouver.com</a>, while the VS.net site will get used for testing and further development of the "place" objects that I have in mind.</p>
