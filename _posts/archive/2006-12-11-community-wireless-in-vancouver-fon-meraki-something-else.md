<p>So, in recent discussions with folks like <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren Barefoot</a> as well as <a href="http://cust.educ.ubc.ca/programs_/maed/instructors/davidvogt.htm">David Vogt</a> of <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca">Mobile Muse</a> (and, of course, kicking the idea around the <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> offices), it&#39;s become clear that community wireless in Vancouver is something that really should happen. We&#39;ve got the <a href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com">Olympics in 2010</a> staring us in the face, and it seems like that&#39;s a good deadline to try and accomplish a variety of innovative things. </p><p><a href="http://bcwireless.net">BC Wireless</a> has been around for quite some time, but hasn&#39;t really crossed over from the geek side. Actually, I need to give it some more time. I reactivated the wiki account I have there and spent some time looking at the various projects going on. The <a href="https://www.bcwireless.net/users/view.post.php?id=477&amp;tid=477">&quot;to do&quot; of analyzing&nbsp; the various hardware access points that are available</a> looks promising. </p><p>While involvement from the various Vancouver municipalities would be ideal, there are other things that can happen from a grassroots perspective. This led me to start poking around some of the technology pieces.</p><p>Both <a href="http://en.fon.com/">FON</a> and <a href="http://www.meraki.net/">Meraki</a> look interesting. Anyone have pointers to similar, off-the-shelf inexpensive wireless access points? Mesh solutions </p><p>FON is closely related to voice / VoIP &quot;stuff&quot; and has a compact router for $30US including shipping. That&#39;s cheap enough to pick up a couple just to mess around with. Oops! Except their <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/?language=en">store</a> only lists the US under North America...The discussion of <a href="http://en.fon.com/info/whats_fon.php#Fonera">&quot;what is FON&quot;</a> which describes the range of sharing to pay users is a good place to start. If there is interest (leave a comment) I&#39;ll try and get a contact with FON about doing a bulk / special order to Canada. Or at least, Vancouver for starters.</p><p>Meraki has had some <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2006/12/01/google-invests-less-than-1m-in-wireless-router-meraki-for-indoor-wifi/">investment from Google</a> and is currently in beta for both pricing and the service. The hardware units are tied to a back end management system for which they also charge for. I sent an email asking about the beta program and got a price list. The nice thing is that they also have ruggedized outdoor units as opposed to the cheap indoor FON units. As well, they are a mesh solution, so can seamlessly cover wide areas.<br /></p><p>I sent a follow up email essentially asking &quot;Why Meraki?&quot;...I guess I&#39;m leery of getting locked into a backend management system that charges fees. FON of course has a system as well, but doesn&#39;t charge end users directly. </p><p>I&#39;ll leave it up to Darren to post a poll / survey asking if you would share your home and/or business data connection in order to help blanket Vancouver in wireless...</p><p>Other interesting community wireless projects in Canada include <a href="http://wirelesstoronto.ca/">Wireless Toronto</a> and <a href="http://www.ilesansfil.org/">&icirc;le Sans Fil (Montreal)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
