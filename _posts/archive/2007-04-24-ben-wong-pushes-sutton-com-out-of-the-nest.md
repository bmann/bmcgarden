<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.mostlygeek.com/2007/04/23/sutton-2-0/">Ben Wong for the launch</a> of <a href="http://www.sutton.com">Sutton.com</a>. Sutton is one of Canada&#39;s largest real estate companies, and it now has a nice and clean &quot;Web 2.0&quot; style website. Well, maybe not THAT web 2.0 &ndash; a distinct lack of tag clouds :P</p><p>What it does have is a Drupal powered backend, cleanly designed HTML and highly search engine friendly structure.</p><p>It was very nice of Ben to mention <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> as part of the team that put Sutton.com together. Actually this was something that I and other members of the team were involved in even before there was a Bryght. In reality, most of the kudos should go to Ben himself, who is not only a programming and sysadmin ninja, but also did a great job of managing the dev team to see this to completion. And of course, <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a>&#39;s <a href="http://brightcreative.com/">Bright Creative</a> consultancy is who did the great design.</p><p>I&#39;ll be watching this site with interest, and hope Ben will give us a report on traffic and other commentary in a month or so from now. I know there are many more possibilities waiting in the wings, especially now that they&#39;ve got a web application framework in the form of Drupal underneath. Who knows, they might even add tag clouds...&nbsp;</p>
