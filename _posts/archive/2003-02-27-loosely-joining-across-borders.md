"<A HREF=http://v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=339>The minimal compact: An open-source constitution for post-national states</A>"
by Adam Greenfield, February 26 2003
"What sorts of arrangements of power between humans can account for the deep variation in beliefs and assumptions among the six billion of us who share this planet, while still providing for a common jurisprudence? What measures can be taken that enhance the common security without unduly infringing on the sovereignty of the individual? I believe that a useful model for the desired structure can be found in the open-source or "free" software movement."
