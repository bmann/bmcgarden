What an incredible application. OK, it's in alpha right now, but its promise is, well, promising.

I think it embodies parts of what I think of with the term <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node.php?id=206">intertwingling</a>. At its most basic, it is a Personal Information Manager (PIM) that strives to be an Outlook clone. But that's just the beginning. It's also kind of like <a href="http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/">Zoe</a>, in that you can look at different slices/views/spaces of information.

And where did I magically find this? Intertwingling...check my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node.php?id=205">latest blog entry</a>.
