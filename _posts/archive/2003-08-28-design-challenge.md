I checked out this <a href="http://www.intersmash.com/challenge/">design challenge</a> -- to have an image inside two columns of text, with the text wrapping around the image.

I spent about 5 minutes or so on it, but I kind of cheated -- <a href="http://midgard.bmannconsulting.com/concepts/2colcenterimg.html">check it</a>. Not only does it use a table (gasp!) but David Hasselhof got cut in half...

My brain is too fuzzy right now to think how to get the image in the middle of the text. This seems like the right track, but it also seems very wrong...

Off to bed. I also have a <a href="http://www.smithdm3.com/archives/000168.html">river to ride</a>.
