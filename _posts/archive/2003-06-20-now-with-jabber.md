I've got my <a href="http://midgard.bmannconsulting.com">home server</a> all tricked-out with various things now.

It used to only have a 2GB hard drive, which I knew I was going to migrate at some point, so I just stopped fiddling with it. As it was, it stayed up for 200 days straight, and the beginning of that 200 was a power outage. So, it was up for probably about a year or so.

It is, of course, running <a href="http://www.e-smith.org">E-Smith</a>. Now the latest version, 5.6. Or it was, until the 6.0beta which literally just got released...think I'll pass on that in favour of stability for now.

So, <strong>odin</strong> (as the system is affectionately known -- my Windows PC is <strong>loki</strong>) now has an 80GB hard drive just waiting to get filled with stuff. It will continue to house my <a href="http://gallery.bmannconsulting.com">gallery</a>, but I'm starting to add other things.

A prime example being a jabber server -- jabber.bmannconsulting.com. If you would like an account on the system, jabber or otherwise, give me a shout. I now have the space available to offer system accounts to any that want them. The only caveat is that the system is on a plain old DSL line, so bandwidth is limited.
