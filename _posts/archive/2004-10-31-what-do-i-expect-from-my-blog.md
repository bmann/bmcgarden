Chris from the <a href="http://www.bicg.org/" title="Bali Consulting">Bali International Consulting Group</a> posted the following as a <a href="/about#comment-3084">comment on my about page</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Boris,</p>

<p>just really curious how you can handle such a blog and if its worth it...</p>

<p>what you expect from it and what you really gain?</p>

<p>saw your Bali pic, I live there, so looked for Bali Consulting on Googloe and found you...quite some trouble with those search engines lately, might be better to stick to yellow pages ;-)</p>

<p>anyhow don't get me wrong, just curious...</p>

<p>Best</p>

<p>Great question, Chris. For some of the reasons I run this site, check out my <a href="/node/1290">Blogging for Business</a> talk.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>But it started off because I wanted to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wanted to have my own domain/site that didn't depend on the particular access provider I was using</li><li>Experiment with web-based tools</li><li>Have a place to put thoughts, ideas, etc. online where I could share them</li><li>Keep in touch with friends and family who lived elsewhere</li></ol>
<p>The site started off with more of a personal focus. But, many of the things I'm interested in center around technology. I've always done a certain amount of research and analysis in positions I've held, so some of this translates over into the writing I do here. As more people began to read this site, and especially as I became a small business owner and then an independent consultant, I wrote more about technology and business.</p>

<p>So, what do I expect? I've always written here for my own purposes -- that is, I've wanted/needed to put thoughts down, and this site serves as a good way to organize them.</p>

<p>What do I hope to gain? Connections. Conversation. Opportunities. I've gained all three through this site.</p>

<p>You also asked how I &quot;handle&quot; the site. Well, it runs on a system called <a href="http://www.drupal.org" title="Open Source Content Management Platform">Drupal</a>, if that's what you mean, and is hosted by my company, <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a>. If you mean the time commitment...well, I'm writing a lot less here than I have before, but that's because I also write elsewhere. Writing 2 or 3 posts a week is something that anyone can handle, and you can usually find at least 2 or 3 items of interest to you in that time frame.</p>

<p>I hope that helps answer your questions: hearing from someone so far away is why, yes, it is absolutely worth running this site. <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> if I can help you with anything else. My company doesn't have any representation in Bali yet...</p>
