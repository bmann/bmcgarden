<p>Yep. Here's <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google on your desktop</a>. It searches Outlook and Outlook Express email, Internet Explorer, AOL IM chats, and all the MS Office formats.</p><p>Check out <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000966.php">John Batelle's Searchblog</a> for an interview and more cogent analsis. I'm just sad I can't use it (although I suspect third-party APIs will mean a ton of applications in the next couple of weeks). Hmmm...Google Image search that automatically checks <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> as well...</p>

<p>Second &quot;hmmm&quot;: imagine <a href="http://www.zoe.nu/">Zoe</a>, except implemented as Google Desktop for the Mac: iPhoto, Address Book, Mail, etc. etc. all with intertwined search results.</p>

<p>Do you think Google is working on this for the Mac? Somehow, I doubt it. They'll get a bunch of this functionality &quot;for free&quot; when Tiger ships (so if they are working on it, they'll make sure it ships with Tiger). But given Jobs' pitching of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/spotlight.html">Spotlight</a>, it may be up to a third party to tackle this.</p>
