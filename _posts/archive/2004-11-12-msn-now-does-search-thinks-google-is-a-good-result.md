<p>So <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/">MSN now does search</a>. I was going to skip commenting on it, since it's not very interesting until we see some advertising plans or something else that's actually new and different.</p>

<p>There was discussion on <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001031.php">John Battelle's search blog</a> on how Google's website was actually showing up in some searches, suggesting that some results were "hand-tweaked".</p>

<p>A search for "canadian voip" returns Google as the #1 hit. I know that I and others have linked to Google searches, especially with title tags of "Google Search for Canadian VoIP", so that may help explain it.</p>

<p>There are a handful of other searches where Google.com is either the #1 hit or somewhere in the top 10. Ouch...I think there will be some "hand tweaking" to remove results that include Google.com...</p>
