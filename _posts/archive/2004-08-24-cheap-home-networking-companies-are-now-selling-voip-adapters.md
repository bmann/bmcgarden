I’ve been predicting this for months, and it looks like it’s finally happened: the commodity-networking companies are starting to do VoIP. Yesterday, both <a href="http://news.com.com/Netgear%2C+Vonage+gear+up+for+VoIP/2100-7352_3-5320926.html?tag=nefd.hed">Netgear</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/Linksys%2C+Vonage+connect+on+VoIP/2100-7352_3-5321184.html?tag=nefd.top">Linksys</a> announced deals with Vonage.
