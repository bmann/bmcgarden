<a href="http://www.mysettopbox.tv">MySettopBox.tv</a> has made it really, really simple to get <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a> running. They've created <a href="http://mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html">KnoppMyth</a>, a distribution that combines <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/" title="Knoppix -- full Linux distribution that boots off a CD">Knoppix</a> with MythTV so that a MythTV install can run directly off a CD.

Read on for the scoop why this is <strong>very</strong> useful.

This does increase both the processing and RAM needed if you want to use it seriously, but it is a dead-easy way to "temporarily" setup a PVR, or to test hardware to see if it works. KnoppMyth can then be <a href="http://mysettopbox.tv/doc.html#autoinstall">installed directly to the hard drive</a>.

MythTV would still be my choice today for building a Linux-based media PC -- it is the most complete and the most feature-rich.

The other leading project is <a href="http://freevo.sourceforge.net/">Freevo</a>. The nice part is that it is not an entire distribution, and the binary is self-contained with no external dependencies, meaning you could install it on a "regular" Linux machine and <em>boom!</em> you've got full-fledged PVR functionality as well.
