<p>Mike Davidson thinks that this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2004/12/16/cx_ah_1216aapl.html">Forbes article</a> confirms the fact that we may see an &quot;iPhone&quot; next year.</p>
<blockquote>
Apple has confirmed that not only will they be releasing a full-fledged Apple-inspired phone with Motorola circuitry, but it will likely be shown off in January to an eagerly-awaiting public at MacWorld Expo.

<p>This certainly could be another use for the CompactFlash memory rumours that had people speculating about a CF-based iPod. As noted in the Forbes article, the carriers may not like this -- being able to load content onto the phone without using their data services is what they really fear: it means their expensive investments in upgrading their networks is being neatly side-stepped. Hmmm...sounds kind of like the rest of the telecom industry.</p>
