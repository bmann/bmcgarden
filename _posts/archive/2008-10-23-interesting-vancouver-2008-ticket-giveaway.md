I <a href="http://interestingvancouver2008.eventbrite.com/">bought a ticket</a> some time ago, but as it turns out, a good friend is leaving for South America and it conflicts with his going away party.

If you're interested in going to Interesting Vancouver and would like to use my ticket, <a href="/contact/">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/bmann">Twitter</a> me.

<strong>Update</strong> the ticket ended up going to <a href="http://webfoot.com/ducky.home.php">Ducky Sherwood</a> (who also happens to be looking for a programming job here in Vancouver, especially at a startup). I expect a blog report from her in exchange, and in the meantime, check out <a href="http://vorg.ca/2971-Interesting-Vancouver-2008-Recap">Dustin Sacks' excellent recap</a>… makes me sorry to have missed it…
