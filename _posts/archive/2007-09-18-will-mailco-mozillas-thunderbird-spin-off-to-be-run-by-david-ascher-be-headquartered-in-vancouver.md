<p>OK, OK, that's a ridiculously long title. But it's great to hear that <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/2007/09/17/joining-mozilla/">David Ascher will be heading MailCo</a> and taking Thunderbird in to a brave new adventure.</p>

<p>Stay in Vancouver? Yes, please! We're on a roll, here, and I'm rooting for more open source businesses to grow up here.</p>
