The <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/">web developer's list</a> I'm on had an interesting thread this morning about detecting where people are geographically when they come to your website.

First, there is <a href="http://www.networldmap.com/">Networldmap</a>, where you can visit and let them know what city you are coming from to help them update their database.

But, it all seems to be run by <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/">GeoBytes</a>, which is commercial. They do have some <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/GeoPhrase.htm">cool free services</a>, although their advanced stuff requires you to register. The fact that it is Javascript-only is kind of annoying -- I'd love to be able to call it in PHP scripts. I'm sure there are some more free location-based databases, but I haven't had the need to search for them yet.
