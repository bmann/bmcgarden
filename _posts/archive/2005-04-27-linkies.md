<p>Yep, it's link roundup time. I have stuff that needs posting over on the personal site, too.</p><ul><li>My dad left for his pilgrim's walk today, and came by the office first. Kris took a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/11229342/">picture</a>. Yep, he's got a <a href="http://pilgramage.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.</li><li>The XBox 360, a.k.a. XBox 2, is coming out soon. <a href="http://scottstuff.net/scott/archives/000413.html">Scott</a> talks about backwards compatility. I've been tempted to get an XBox 1 to act as media center, due to it's extreme hackability. Will version 2 also be hack-friendly?</li><li>I read Fraser Speirs' ideas around <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/fraserspeirs/868220.html">Neutrino XML</a> with interest. Then I reallized it was pretty much OPML. And of course, I already have the <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com/borisphere">borisphere</a>.</li><li>Fred does a great job talking about the <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/04/linking_in.html">benefits of LinkedIn</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> lent me Firefly on DVD and I was hooked, so I'm looking forward to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/serenity/">Serenity</a> movie. Could this be a way to re-launch the series?</li><li>The <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0504/05042201canons2is.asp">Canon S2 IS</a>, the successor to my S1, just got released. <a href="http://home.justwerks.com">Evan</a> was sitting on the fence for quite some time, this might push him over to buy it. Heck, I'm thinking of giving my S1 to <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com">Richard</a> for services rendered and getting it myself. Only annoying bit: they changed the memory card format from Compact Flash to SD, and I have quite a few CF cards already.</li><li><a href="http://www.anisotropic.net/node/122">Jeffie is building Drupal stuff and making fun of Dries</a> -- &quot;I am slowly getting a clearer picture of what a demented little monkey Dries is&quot;</li></ul>









<p>Aside: is some of this stuff &quot;personal&quot; and shouldn't be here? I'm really bad at keeping my life in little boxes scattered all over the place...</p>
