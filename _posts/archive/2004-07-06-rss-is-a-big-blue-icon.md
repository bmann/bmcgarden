<img src="http://paolo.evectors.it/myImages/RSSicon.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Among the other news from yesterday's Apple Developers Conference <a href="http://stream.apple.akadns.net/">keynote</a>, it's interesting to note that apple picked the blue RSS icon and not the orange XML one to represent RSS (and Atom).<br><br>
Even if I'm a long time orange icon user and fan, I think I can imagine
Apple thinking: "why using an icon with the word 'XML' to link to
something we call 'RSS'?". It's true: users are smart, but why making
their life harder?

<p>I laughed when I read this. It's true, an icon labelled "RSS" does make a lot more sense. Also, regardless of format (e.g. Atom), RSS is the branding term.</p>
