<p>I'm heading over to the <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice 2008 organizer's debrief</a>.</p>

<p>My take on our current attendee split: edu-bloggers, industry veterans coming to connect with their members and/or promote a new social media service, and a large contingent of personal bloggers, as was our original mission. Does this seem accurate to you?</p>

<p>I mention <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca/session/f-stats-make-art">Dave Olson's F*** Stats, Make Art presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Next year is going to be tough (well, it feels that way for *me* who has been overly busy and didn't contribute as much to the pre-organization), but we're now a registered society in BC. What will this let us accomplish? Not sure, but certainly could be interesting. I have some ideas for the 2010 "Olympics" edition of Northern Voice....</p>
