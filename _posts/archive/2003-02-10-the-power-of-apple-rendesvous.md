<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/technology/content/feb2003/tc2003025_0198_tc056.htm?tc">This article</a> at Business Week talks about Rendesvous, and some of the absolutely astounding things you can do with it, like auto-configure printers on a network without having to sort through IP addresses, or how some 3D software vendor built it into their products, and now the software can wirelessly locate available machines and distribute the workload to them.  That is not only a case for Rendesvous, but 802.11g in the workplace of some graphics and 3D workgroups, too.

Definitely a must-read for people interested in elegant, simple technology that could make the Windows platform a lot more painless to enterprise/office workers, or make the Mac a far more appealing platform for that environment.
