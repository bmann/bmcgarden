[image:590,left,5,5]<p>I got wind of this barebones/media center box from Asus through <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/33262.html" title="Asus unveils DiGiMatrix hi-fi styled home PC">The Register</a>, but a quick Google search come up with a much better story by <a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mmedia/display/20030909020224.html" title="ASUS DiGiMatrix: a Barebone or an Ultimate Media Center?">X-Bit Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the best features: 5-in-1 card reader, built in 802.11b wireless access point, dual Ethernet (10/100 and Gigabit), listen to audio (incl. radio, CD, and MP3-CD) without turning the computer on. Read more for labelled pics of the front and back plus some musings.</p>

<p>It's amazing how many features are packed into this. I think that manufacturers are reallizing that small operators simply don't have the resources to re-purpose a more standard barebones box into one customized for multimedia. Hence the decision to drop a bunch of PCI or AGP expansion slots and build it in from the start.</p>

<p>Software is the second issue. From the X-bit Labs article:</p>
<blockquote>
Maybe ASUS will provide a special version of Windows XP for this kind of personal computers, but since Windows XP costs an extra $75 ~ $100[US], ASUS may supply only its own software with the DiGiMatrix.
</blockquote>

<p>XP Media Center is a) unlikely to be certified for use by ASUS (they're too friendly with DIY'ers) and b) I imagine the licensing cost is even higher than for "regular" XP Home. If ASUS <strong>is</strong> working on its own software, that would be amazing. Basically, your choices are to run Windows XP plus a bunch of third-party software (software isn't designed to work together, full-blown GUI system when all you need is a bunch of on-screen menus, potential driver isssues, expensive) or struggle to get drivers working for a multimedia PC Linux distribution (difficult, if not impossible, especially for such integrated/customized hardware).</p>

<p>Hmmm...makes me think of some sort of <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">QT</a>- or <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/" title="wxWindows cross-platform GUI framework">wxWindows</a>-based GUI front-end that implements all the standard multimedia PC functions: TV, photo albums, MP3s, etc. etc. With the cross platform frameworks I mentioned, it has the potential to work on multiple hardware/OS platforms.</p>

<p>The only down sides that I could see pointed out were part of the strength here, too -- lack of expandability. But, this is not a gaming machine -- it's a multimedia PC/server, and it seems to have everything required. The one bone-headed move: placing the S/PDIF output on the <em>front</em> panel. This means you need to have the front panel permanently flipped down, with a cable coming out the front and (presumably) going into the back of your receiver.</p>
