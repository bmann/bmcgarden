<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver">BarCamp Vancouver</a> is coming up quickly. It will take place in Bryght&#39;s new offices at the edge of Gastown. Now we have to talk to the construction dudes and make sure they finish in time. Add it to your <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/87852/">calendar on upcoming</a>. </p><p><a href="http://www.moosehat.com/">Stewart Marshall</a> actually emailed me, concerned that my name wasn&#39;t on the list...I stuck my name on the <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouverRegistry">attendee list</a> -- technically we&#39;re maxed at 90 people, so there are only 3 slots left as I am posting. </p><p>It&#39;s a great list of folks on there already, and I keep bumping into more that should come. Specifically, I attended the <a href="/blog/bmann/googles-challenge-searching-the-live-web">Google presentation at VanHPC</a> last night, and bumped into a few folks:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.stewartclan.ca/blogs/thinkingGeek/">Michael Stewart</a>, who works at BCIT and is digging into identity (and who tells me his friend <a href="http://www.mynameiskate.ca/">Kate</a> is moving to Vancouver...excellent, more cool locals)<br /> </li><li><a href="http://www.chani3.com/">Chani</a>, who is going back to school for a CS degree at UBC...she reminds me of some other smart, cool geek girls I know like <a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph">Sacha Chua</a> and <a href="http://hypatia.ca/">Leigh Honeywell</a> (that&#39;s a compliment)  </li><li><a href="http://www.juneharman.com/jmdyck/">Michael Dyck</a>, who spends time working on the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net">Distributed Proofreaders</a> project that helps with <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg</a> (he should talk about this at BarCamp Vancouver)<br /></li><li><a href="http://group42.ca/">Dale McGladdery</a>, who is&nbsp; my partner in crime in helping to organize the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/vancouver">Vancouver Drupalleers</a> and is looking for something to get into outside of his BigCo dayjob<br /></li></ul><p>I see Michael Stewart and Chani have already added themselves, and of course Dale is #5 with a bullet on the attendee list. So much other tech (<a href="http://www.brightsidetech.com/">BrightSide</a> display tech) and people (yay! <a href="http://brepettis.com/">Bre</a> is coming from out of town, <a href="http://www.podcasthotel.com">Alex Williams</a> will be podcasting) Good stuff!</p><p>And <a href="http://hartshorne.ca/">Beau Hartshorne</a>, who came by the office today, added himself as well.</p><p>He&#39;s got a very interesting AJAX image editing interface at SnipShot and is working on all sorts of other innovative things. He&#39;s currently debating whether to add his innovation to the local Vancouver environment or to take off back to Silicon Valley, where he attended startup school as part of <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> (yes, we need this here...the <a href="http://www.innovationcommons.ca">Innovation Commons</a> might play host to such a thing). </p><p>Whew! Things don&#39;t slow down in the summer. I&#39;m happy to be in town until the end of September, and it looks like I won&#39;t have any shortage of things to do. For now...off to the parents on Bowen Island for a rest. Enjoy your weekends...  </p>
