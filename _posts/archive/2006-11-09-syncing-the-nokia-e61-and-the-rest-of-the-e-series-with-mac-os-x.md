<p>My friend <a href="http://www.stewart-marshall.com/">Stewart Marshall</a> took the plunge and also got an E61 after seeing mine. He ended up ordering from <a href="http://www.expansys.ca">Expansys</a> -- they look like a really great online store to order mobile gear from in Canada. I had noticed them before and will probably be getting a cheapo GPS unit from there to experiment with.</p><p>In any case, Stewart was asking about syncing with the Mac. There isn&#39;t an E-series compatible plugin for iSync yet, but there are various instructions for enabling this floating around.</p><p>I used the very <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060511162644120">geeky instructions from Mac OS X Hints</a>. There is also a <a href="http://www.e-series.org/archives/28">free plugin</a> described here, although some people seem to have trouble with it.&nbsp;</p>
