Go to <a href="http://www.goskokie.com">GoSkokie.com</a>: "news for the people by the people." It's the fruit of the <a href="http://mesh.medill.northwestern.edu/blogs/advance/">hyperlocal project</a> at Northwestern. Very exciting to see something grow from concept to reality so quickly.<cite><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_04_25.html#006917">BuzzMachine: Hyper about hyperlocal</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>This is what we're trying to do with <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com" title="Urban Vancouver - Local News Powered by You">UrbanVancouver.com</a>.</p>

The phrase <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22open+source+journalism%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">open source journalism</a> seems to be much used already, but I think that's part of it.</p>
