<p>I'm currently in Stuttgart, Germany doing some Drupal client work in a gathering that we've come to call "Geek Week". We sit down and look at internal requirements and do 3/6/12 month planning, matched up with the state of the Drupal universe. But more on that later, probably over at <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com">RCS</a> (the "In Drupal We Trust" t-shirts were popular).</p>

<p>One of the "geeks" attending here is <a href="http://bendiken.net/">Arto Bendiken</a>. Check out his <a href="http://bendiken.net/projects">projects page</a> for an example of some of the stuff he's worked on. For Drupal folks, that would be <a href="http://drupal.org/project/timeline">timeline - AJAX widget for visualizing temporal information</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/boost">boost - static page caching for Drupal</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">drush - command line shell for Drupal</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/trace">trace - easy debugging for Drupal</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/exhibit">exhibit - rich visualization and faceted browsing</a>. Yes, that is impressive :P</p>

<p>So, Arto and I got to talking about RDF (<a href="http://rdfabout.com">rdfabout.com</a> is a good primer site), and how it's the new black. I admit that I've felt that XML vs. RDF is (almost?) a religious war. It seems to me that pointy haired bosses (PHBs) have memorized that RDF == slow and complex, and XML == fast and ubiquitous. Since in selling concepts I often interact with PHBs, RDF has felt like an uphill battle, especially as RSS/Atom grow more and more widespread.</p>

<p>But.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I think I'm almost convinced that the scales are tipping in favor of RDF for enabling new, distributed actions. Looking at new companies like <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">Nova Spivack's</a> <a href="http://www.twine.com">Twine</a> or <a href="http://www.freebase.com">MetaWeb's Freebase</a>, we are seeing new capabilities emerge based on using RDF.</p>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> is another new piece, in fact just <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">ratified as W3C recommendation as of yesterday</a>. In short, a way to do queries across data at multiple sources, rather than having to rely on the aggregate-and-query-locally.</p>

<p>Here's an image of the data that is currently available as RDF. Please ignore the FOAF bubble in the middle, we really do need to replace that with something better :P</p>
