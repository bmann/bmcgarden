<p>Not a big thesis on this topic, just an observation that this evening, as I was thinking about organizing something with friends for tomorrow morning, my instinct was to open a tab and go to Facebook to contact them...rather than email.</p>

<p>And of course, this is exactly what <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState's</a> <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/your-upfors">Up4 Facebook app</a> is trying to help with as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And of course, today I see that Facebook has added straight-to-email messaging -- "No more switching back and forth between email and Facebook. When you are writing a message, simply enter any email addresses into the “To:” field.". There is a longer <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=5344177130">post on the Facebook blog</a> about this.</p>
