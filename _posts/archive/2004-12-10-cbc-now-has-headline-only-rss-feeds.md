<p>Welcome to the party, CBC! Although that's about all the nice things I have to say about their implementation...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/638#comment-3359">Someone left me a comment</a> with a link directly to the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/rss/feed.html">free headlines page</a> that lists all the RSS feeds available. Conveniently, that let me skip past the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/rss/">agreement</a> page.</p>

<p>The agreement (which I didn't agree to, since I have that <a title="CBC RSS Feed Page" href="http://www.cbc.ca/rss/feed.html">URL that jumps straight to the feed page</a>) has some fun stuff in it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Website Exclusivity. You guarantee that the CBC Feed or Feed Content shall be the exclusive content on your website from a general news and information provider.</p> 

<p>Promotion. You shall not make any promotion or advertisement of the CBC Feed or Feed Content, without the written authorization of CBC/Radio-Canada.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm...I hope this isn't promoting the feed. Actually, I'm not going to include it in my <a href="/aggregator">aggregator</a> here, because I might be accused of being a commercial user. Not that I would be interested in doing that -- it's a headline-only feed, which lost its appeal about 30 seconds after people starting using RSS.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the agreement has been removed, and I sent a <a href="/node/1403" title="Feedback on CBC RSS">feedback email</a> asking for (at least) teaser feeds.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>And exclusivity?! Who are they kidding?</p>

<p>There is a pretty good selection of content, split into General, Sports, and Regional (one per province). Do I need to mention the part about it being a headline only feed again?</p>

<p>They've thoughtfully provided a list of news readers at the bottom of the page...cleverly missing such popular clients as <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>. Actually, the two Mac ones they mention are ones that I've never heard of. They actually mention My Yahoo! as an option, bu then cunningly only include a link to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> in the web category of their list of readers.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I'm done beating up CBC for the day. They have an email address listed (headlines AT cbc.ca), so I'll send them an email tomorrow, politely asking for (at least) a teaser feed.</p>
