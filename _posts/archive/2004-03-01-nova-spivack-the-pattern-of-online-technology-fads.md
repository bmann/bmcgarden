<p>Nova Spivack does a very good job of tracing some themes/memes of online technology development in four areas: content, communication, collaboration, and community. Some of his thoughts closely parallel many of the things that I have been saying (privately) about social networking applications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key lesson here is that mere "Community Platform" companies did not become big businesses in their own right -- those that survived had to either verticalize or focus on enterprise collaboration. The same will be true of companies that provide platforms for social networking in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely: as I stated in my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/926" title="Robert Scoble: I still don't get social software">recent post to Scoble</a>, neither <strike>blogging</strike> personal publishing nor social networking are an end goal in and of themselves -- they are merely new features. I feel even more strongly that all four areas that Nova mentions are headed on a direct collision courseâ€¦</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I crossed out "blogging" because it is not a good term. It is understandable to the industry, to those that self-identify with this new label, but it is not a good description of what it actually is. To me, it's personal publishing. I need to (consciously) start using this label, because it's important.</p>

<p>As Nova does, I see big parallels to the birth of desktop publishing. Actually, I think personal publishing hasn't really arrive yet: everyone can/does desktop publish, very few people (relatively speaking) are involved in personal publishing. In dealing with businesses, I still see lots of problems with basic website publishing: the belief that it is hard, coupled with the belief that paying your neighbour's kid's friends a few bucks is the end goal of establishing a good web presence.</p>

<p>Similarly, we're halfway through the 2000's and Nova's current identification of <em>"Wikis, Decentralized Collaboration & Semantic Webs"</em> as the status-quo for collaboration really doesn't seem to measure up with reality. His list of technologies for the previous step are <em>"Groupware, KM, and Intranets"</em>. To which I offer some counterpoints: most small businesses don't have any one of those tools, and even large companies struggle with all three of those items.</p>

<p>Whew! This is starting to get long. Nova: as I recently <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/932" title="The bit about pushing, and playing devil's advocate">said to Roland</a>, I do well in a "devil's advocate" role -- I love being able to think about what you've presented in this post.</p>

<p>Nova has "persistent identity and relationship management" in the communication category, whereas I would place those functions squarely in community. I would say that boundaries between "Content, Communication, Collaboration, and Community" are becoming very blurry (if indeed there were any to begin with).</p>

<p>There is lots more to think about here. To sum up, I think that "not quite there yet" applies to a lot of these categories -- best practices are only now starting to emerge, and the current crop of "new" technologies have arisen out of identified failures in the current best practices.</p>
