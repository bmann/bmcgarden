Greg wants to use <a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> to post to this site. So, I installed it on my PC machine (using RDC, of course) and am typing this entry.

Of course, no topic support, and I guess default posts go to your personal blog.

So, the instructions. Download and install w.bloggar. Run it and fill in your BMC username and password. w.bloggar will prompt you if you want to "create" this account. Change the blog type to Drupal, change the path to "xmlrpc.php", and set the host to www.bmannconsulting.com. If you've done it correctly, a "Post" window should appear.
