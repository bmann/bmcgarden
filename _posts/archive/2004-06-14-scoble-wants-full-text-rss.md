<p>Why should I care? Well, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/12.html#a7750">he's cleaning out his RSS feeds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm cleaning out my RSS feeds. Things that'll get feeds removed:</p>
<p>1) If I haven't read you for months.<br />
2) If you don't publish full content feeds.<br />
3) If you haven't published for months.<br />
<p>I wish it were easier in NewsGator to delete feeds. Right now I have to delete them one-by-one and it's frustrating.</p>
<p>I'll publish a new OPML file later.</p>

<p>I can't do anything about #1, and I overdid it with #3 today. What did I do? Ran to my shell account, edited a couple of files, and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/6741">hacked full text feeds into my install of Drupal</a>. And hey, Robert, I have <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1232">XAML</a> on my front page, so there's another reason to keep reading me.</p>
