<p><a href="http://joshp.typepad.com/15/2005/07/seriously_jokin.html">Josh Peterson compares and contrasts attitudes towards using their maps</a> at Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>Let's do a little summary (but go read Josh's post for the note of incredulity and the links to some of these things):</p>
<ul>
<li>Google has open APIs, and is putting up prize money for innovative uses of the API, and allows commercial usage (oh, right, and has that whole <a href="http://earth.google.com/">3D Earth thing</a>, too)</li>
<li>Yahoo has open APIs, but doesn't allow commercial usage</li>
<li>Microsoft's MapPoint charges per map generated</li>
</ul>

<p>If I were a commercial entity relying on mapping, I would actually <em>want</em> to pay Google (or whomever) to ensure service and support. But if I had the flexibility to decide for myself to NOT pay, and still get great service (or &quot;good enough&quot;, given my business model, risk tolerance, etc.)...well, yeah, that's the option I would pick.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> this <a href="http://geobloggers.blogspot.com/2005/06/network-link-killer-app-for-google.html">network link connection to Google Earth</a> is almost enough incentive to rush out and buy a Windows machine to run Google Earth on. Yes, I just blew my own mind.</p>

<p>BTW, one of Josh's <a href="/http:/www.43places.com">43 Places</a> users put together a <a href="http://joshp.typepad.com/15/2005/07/43tokyo.html">Greasemonkey script that adds Google Maps to 43 places</a>.</p>
