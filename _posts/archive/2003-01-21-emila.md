<strong>What is Emila?</strong>
Emila is an indexing and search tool for your email. It creates a master database of your existing email, and lets you perform various kinds of searching and filtering on that database.

<strong>What's the deal with the name?</strong>
Emila is a different way to look at email. Get it? Get it? Ha! 
</blockquote>

Basically, think of cross-referencing every single email that you have, using every single piece of information attached to the email -- sender, domain, date, subject, etc. etc.

Definitely a fine example of intertwingling. Am going off to install it now (and then I'm going to bed...no, really, I am).
