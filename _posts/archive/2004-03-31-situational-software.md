<p>Lot's of people have pointed to <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html">Shirky's Situated Software</a>. Here's Greg's take on it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 example, almost anything from IETF pre-1994 fits his description, including TCP/IP, DNS (hence named), SMTP (hence sendmail), NNTP (hence nntpd), and HTTP (hence CERN & NCSA). Their method & 'tao' were 'situated' in performance, reliability and interoperability.</p>

<p>With Netscape and Apache, we cross into a 'scale' paradigm.</p>

<p>You look at Xerox PARC, it was designed to facilitate staff being 'situated'. Same with Bell Labs, same with Media Labs. It's long been a fundamental aspect of management to get best results.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Shirky doesn't say how long it took them to write the program. It would take me a day.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Drupal</li>
<li>Use polls or ratings module, create a node for each prof</li>
<li>Create user accounts with default passwords</li>
<li>Mail out user details</li>
</ol>

<p>My other comment: how is this different from prototypes?</p>
