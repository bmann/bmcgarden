I have been doing lots of work lately on table-less layouts, and finally found a little time to come back and finish implementing it here. The default theme (if you haven't selected one in your (<a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=user">user account</a>) is now one of my own making, as opposed to a slightly adapted one that I got <a href="http://www.trip.ee">elsewhere</a>.

This theme is called "notable" -- get it, get it?!?

Hopefully it isn't horribly broken in strange and unnamed browsers. I started off with some CSS <a href="http://www.glish.com/css/7.asp">from Glish.com</a> that is supposed to contain all the "cross browser hacks", but I ended up taking them out.

So far, looks nice in IE6/Win32 and Chimera/OSX. Since most of the visitors here won't deviate too widely from those two, it should be OK. Except if there are still some pesky IE5/Win32 users out there...

And, if you are submitting/commenting, the extra stuff on the left overlaps with the right column. Haven't found what knobs to tweak to affect those sections yet.

If you're interested in CSS and table-less layouts, check out the Web Tools section in links.
