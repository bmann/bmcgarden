<p>Seems I set off a bit of an avalanche of feed reader switching (and lots of <a href="/blog/bmann/switching-to-google-reader">comments on the first post</a>), so I thought I would post an update.</p><p>Short answer: it&#39;s working for me, and this is almost entirely due to how well the mobile mode works. I can now easily fit feed reading into a few spare moments. Starring items is how I mark them for followup.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have some issues / wishlist items for Google Reader...but rather than list them, I&#39;ll send you off to read Jame Healy, who has a great <a href="http://jamehealy.com/blog/jame/google-reader">wishlist</a> (and he just <a href="http://jamehealy.com/blog/jame/google-reader-mobile">fell in love with Google Reader Mobile</a>). I actually found a bit of a solution to the whole del.icio.us sharing issue: <a href="http://www.memerocket.com/2006/11/05/gordita-delicious-tagging-for-google-reader/">Gordita</a>. That link, thanks to Bill Burcham, will create a bookmarklet for you that will let you bookmark items in del.icio.us from your Google Reader page. Now I can go through and bookmark all my starred items. </p><p><a href="http://www.alexharford.com/2006/10/17/google-reader-updated/">Alex Harford</a> wants &quot;oldest first&quot; ordering.</p><p><a href="http://muddylaces.ca/">Greg Fox</a> doesn&#39;t trust online-only apps (<a href="/blog/bmann/switching-to-google-reader#comment-134981">comment</a>):</p><div class="content"><blockquote><p>gmail was pretty crappy for a week and a bit for me.&nbsp; Hard to sell me on the idea of an online life when service outages can just take everything away.&nbsp; At least with desktop tools I can see offline content.</p><p>If google or someone else could create an online store for feeds, and read vs unread items that I can synch from my desktop(s) that would be useful.&nbsp; On the road provide a nice UI.&nbsp; Perhaps google reader already does this.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know since I haven&#39;t checked it out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As far as authenticated feed handling goes, I hope that if they add that feature, they handle it correctly.&nbsp; Some sites authenticate their feeds because it is a pay-for service.&nbsp; Google reader needs to consider the share feature in light of that. </p></blockquote><p>Re: online only. With my new &quot;business class&quot; mobile phone (and, er, my grandfathered unlimited data Fido account), there are very limited places where I am truly &quot;offline&quot;. I agree that more offline or synch services are warranted...but we&#39;re still in early days for feed reading in general. <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2006/11/11/2492577.html">Troy Angrignon</a> and <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/11/09/offline_is_the.html">Paul Kedrosky</a> have some offline/online thoughts lately.</p><p>Your point about &quot;sharing&quot; of for-pay features is, I think, the same as for any other reader: I can easily re-post or otherwise share that content.&nbsp;</p> </div><p>I actually was checking out the <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/10/13/google-reader-redux">Gmail - Google Reader integration via a Greasemonkey</a> script...but this won&#39;t work for me. I use mainly my &quot;business&quot; email which is Bryght&#39;s Gmail for Domains....but then it tries to use THAT version of my &quot;identity&quot; for Reader, as well. Hey, Google, did I mention you&#39;re STILL really screwed up about identity?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I still need something on my desktop for authenticated feeds. I&#39;m going to try out a few other readers to see if they fit this very specific task. My interaction with these feeds are primarily of the sort where it&#39;s *really* important whether or not I&#39;ve actually read them...that is, more like a &quot;to do&quot; list rather than the information trawling I do with my main public feed subscriptions. On the list so far are <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> (not free, but gorgeous UI) and <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/">RSSOwl</a> (free, open source, cross platform, and home page built with Drupal :P).</p>
