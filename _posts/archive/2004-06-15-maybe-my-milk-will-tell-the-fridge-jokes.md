<blockquote>
<p>Screw the disintermediation of traditional advertising, the introduction of disruptive technologies to electronics consumers, and the enabling of networked hardware for ubiquitous seamless e-commerce.</p>

<p>Another great quote was <em>"If you can&#8217;t buy a modem equipped or Bluetooth milk-aware fridge from Hammacher-Schlemmer in the next couple of years, I&#8217;ll make you eat your hat."</em>. </p>
