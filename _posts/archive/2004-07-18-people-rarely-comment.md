People rarely comment on this blog (or most non-political blogs, I've noticed), so feel free to share your best lemons-to-lemonade story with me in a comment, and I promise I'll post the best couple of them pronto!

<p>Comments are in some sense an artifact of early days, when very few people had blogs. These days, much as <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2003/12/06/decentralized">Richard mentioned</a>, it is more common to just write up a blog post on your own site in "response" to someone. All my lengthy comments are done in this way, using either trackback or a short comment just pointing to my own response.</p>

<p>We still need better tools to connect -- we need to be able to talk across mailing lists, newsgroups, blogs -- and comments. And we need to be able to easily follow these conversations wherever they appear.</p>

<p>(and hey, <a href="http://onlyonce.blogs.com/onlyonce/2004/07/turning_lemons_.html">check out Only Once's full post</a>, because it's a good read)</p>
