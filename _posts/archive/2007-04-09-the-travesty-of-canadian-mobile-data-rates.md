Fido and Rogers come in at a whopping $4100 per month, and Telus, who I&#39;ve long dismissed, is actually really competitive.<br /></p>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/453017593/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/453017593_344ba1805e.jpg" alt="Canadian Mobile Data Rate Costs (1GB)" width="500" height="375" /></a>  <p> Much like Net Neutrality, this story needs to get spread. This pricing structure is stifling mobile innovation in Canada. I would argue that it is causing carriers to lose money in the short as well as long term.<br /> <br /> There are groups like <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca">Mobile Muse</a> and others like that are doing innovative stuff. Locked away in research labs or funding short trials, because no one else can afford the data rates. </p>
