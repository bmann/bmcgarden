Compliance with VoIP standards means that users of his product should be able to connect to any other VoIP infrastructure that supports the standard. <strong>This is a terrific competitive advantage over Skype's current closed architecture approach</strong> and should really transform the game. With this product, any of the companies that have made VoIP investments will be able to leverage the p2p VoIP phenomenon using LitFiber's product.

<p>The product in question is <a href="http://www.litfiber.com/italk/">LitFiber's iTALK2U</a>. Emphasis mine, and a statement I definitely agree with.</p>

<p>Just like I <a href="/node/view/1002">posted</a>, they've rolled in access to a bunch of other networks (AIM, ICQ). Still Windows only. From the screenshots (screen cap below), the <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym> is terrible. This one is not a winner.</p>

<p>How hard can it be to build an open source <acronym title="Free World Dialup">FWD</acronym>/regular SIP plug in for one of the instant messaging clients? It should be possible to share a codebase across platforms so the various IM clients can then build individual plug-insâ€¦</p>
