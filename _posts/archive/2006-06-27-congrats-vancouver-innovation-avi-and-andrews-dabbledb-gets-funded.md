<p>Congrats to Avi and Andrew for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/InfectiousGreed?m=2971">getting funded</a>. I&#39;m saying congrats to Vancouver&#39;s innovation with this post as well, and it&#39;s great to see that local Vancouver VC firm <a href="http://ventureswest.com/">Ventures West</a> did this deal.</p>  <p><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul Kedrosky</a> points to Om&#39;s scoop, and calls DabbleDB the first Enterprise 2.0 company. I suspect <a href="http://ventureswest.com/Team/Profiles/Paul_Kedrosky.asp">Paul&#39;s position at VenturesWest</a> had a thing or two with making this deal happen.</p>  <blockquote> I planned to post on this tomorrow, but I see the news is already breaking, and <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/06/26/dabble-db-raises-cash/">Om has the scoop</a>: the venture firm Ventures West in Vancouver has closed a Series A financing round of <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com">Dabble DB</a>. He has it mostly right, including the huge opportunity for Andrew Catton&#39;s and Avi Bryant&#39;s startup. Let&#39;s call this the first truly &quot;Enterprise 2.0&quot; company.<br /> <br />One small correction/comment: The investment size is only Om&#39;s guess, and the actual dollars will not be announced -- whether larger or smaller.&nbsp;</blockquote>Can the local venture and innovation communities continue to churn out winners? I hope so :P<br />
