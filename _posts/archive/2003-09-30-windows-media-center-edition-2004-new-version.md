The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/">new release</a> is out, as mentioned on <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2003/09/windows_xp_medi.html">PVRBlog</a>. He's particularly excited by the "TiVo for Radio" function, which allows for recording/pausing/rewinding of live FM radio (as mentioned in the comments there, there is also <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/index.html">Griffin Technology's RadioShark</a> and <a href="http://www.replay-radio.com/">Replay Radio</a>).

Hmm. It still sucks that it can only be gotten directly bundled with a new PC. I can understand why, but I think that Microsoft would actually <strong>sell</strong> a lot of copies. As per Trevor's <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/322">"How to get rich"</a> post, I think it would open up a lot of revenue for VARs: basically small computer shops or individuals that specialize in setting up media PCs. And this is how MS could sell it: no end-user purchases, only through these VARs. Those who had the know-how could still get it "directly" by going to their local <a href="http://www.oemexpress.com">OEM Express</a> type store, which is basically a DIY parts shop.
