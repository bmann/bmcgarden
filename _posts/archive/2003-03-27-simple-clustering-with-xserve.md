<a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/03/27/xserveipod/">Here is a really interesting article</a> on how a group in the BioTech field can setup an entire XServe cluster by using a 20 GB iPod and a Perl script that auto-configures and installs all software on the Cluster.  Talk about your easy install!

Could this be Apple's ticket to ride in the Enterprise field?  Drastically simplified auto-configuration and installation of Enterprise systems?
