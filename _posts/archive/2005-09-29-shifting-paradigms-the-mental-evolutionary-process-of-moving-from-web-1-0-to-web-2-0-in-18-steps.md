<p>Troy Angrignon does his usual fantastic job of crystallizing and refining all the swirling thoughts about the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. More specifically, he explains the mental evolution that people have to go through to realize what this means to them, and what benefits they can get from it.</p>

<blockquote>
There are several phases that people tend to pass through in their migration from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 thinking.I have watched this transformation over and over as I have had conversations with a lot of people on this subject. As far as I can see this is the general thought pattern that people go through over time.
