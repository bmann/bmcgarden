<p>I don't do these very often, but I really do need to point a handful of things out before they age too much:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://holycola.net/archives/000697.html">Todd Sieling's holycola.net - Wiki critics:</a> Todd, this was an awesome round-up post of everything it means to be wiki. Lots of great quotes, I probably like this one best: &quot;A given technology won't work like it's supposed to unless it's used like it's supposed to be used!&quot; </li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/updates/2005-03.phtml#026193">Gnomedex registration is open:</a> it's in Seattle, and <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie</a> is going to be there. But the big question...do I get to play with the kids again if I go? Also on tap for afterwards: Bowen Island FamilyCon? We'll see on both counts...</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog">Nokia Lifeblog:</a> OK, it's installed on my <a title="Nokia 6630" href="/node/1436">new phone</a>...but it doesn't seem to work. I set up the details for it to work with Flickr, but pictures never actually show up in the Lifeblog app. I haven't read any docs yet, but shouldn't this just work?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=245">Kris Krug - Vancouver BeerCasting at Subeez on March 16, 2005:</a> there are so many things I need to be saying about Kris. He's been &quot;embedded&quot; in our <a title="525 Seymour" href="http://www.bryght.com">office</a> for the last couple of weeks. He put on a <a href="http://www.beercasting.com">BeerCast</a> that I attended, and ended up talking about <a href="http://media2.libsyn.com/podcasts/beercaster/VAC_03-16-2005_1_71.mp3">Reality TV (direct MP3 link)</a>. Kris is also doing interesting things with <a href="http://www.eventblogging.com/">Event Blogging</a> -- he did a fantastic job covering Northern Voice, and now he's experimenting with audio as well. Any event you need photographed, blogged, or recorded, Kris is your guy. Actually, I just talked to Shayne at <a title="Health Resort and Fitness Resort on Forbidden Plateau, part of the Courtenay - Comox Valley" href="http://www.coastaltrek.com">Coastal Trek</a> about having Kris do photography work. I probably have more reasons to throw props Kris' way, but just want to say: been great having you around so far.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think I need to say anything about <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> being acquired by Yahoo. I'll say something including more Y!s over on the company blog.</p>
