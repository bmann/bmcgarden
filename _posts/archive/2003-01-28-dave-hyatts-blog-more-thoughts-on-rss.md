It seems that Dave Hyatt, one of the Safari developers, has also recently started using NetNewsWire to read his news. His two most recent posts talk about his thoughts:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_01.html#002414">More Thoughts on RSS</a>
Then the RSS aggregator becomes useful as a filtering mechanism, with the Web browser being used only to view the articles that you ultimately decide to read.  In this mode it seems like HTML display is hardly even a requirement for the aggregator application, since you basically just want to speed-read the excerpts from the RSS file and only go into the full blog if you decide that it's worth following up on.</blockquote>His other comment about having RSS feeds automatically handled by apps using some sort of protocol signifier is a really good idea, and takes care of Graham's comments on "how to get started with RSS":
<blockquote><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_01.html#002403">Rise of the Uber-browser</a>
I'd like to be able to click on an RSS file link in a browser and have it automatically pass that off to my news application.  One click should be all it takes to get me subscribed, whether that click happens in a mail app, a Web page, or inside NetNewsWire itself.  A protocol handler would work for this.  I think of this as being somewhat similar to the "view-source:" protocol supported in many browsers, i.e., you could just say "rss:original-url" or "feed:original-url" and have the appropriate application configured to handle feed subscriptions.</blockquote>
