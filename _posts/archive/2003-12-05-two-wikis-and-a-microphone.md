<p>Since <a href="http://www.foolswisdom.com">Lloyd</a> shared his desire to implement his site/blog/knowledge-store as a wiki, I've been keeping an eye out for good wiki implementations.</p>

<p><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/12/05/simple">Simon Willison</a> writes about an unusual way of using a wiki to maintain a site without the typical (ugly) wiki look-and-feel:</p>

<blockquote>
[The CMS] was based on <a href="http://tavi.sourceforge.net/">Tavi Wiki</a>, and consisted of a password protected Tavi install for the back end and a slightly modified separate install for the front end. Both installs pointed to the same database, but the front end was altered to disable all editing features and make the site look less like a Wiki. You can see the end result <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/uni/scheme/">here</a>.
