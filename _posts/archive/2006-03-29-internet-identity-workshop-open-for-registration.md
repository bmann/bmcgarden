The next <a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006a/announcement">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> is something I probably need to go to (<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/63871/">upcoming.org</a>).<br /></p><p>IIW is being put together by <a href="http://www.kaliyasblogs.net/Iwoman/">Kaliya</a>, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com">Doc</a>, and <a href="http://www.windley.com">Phil</a>. I'm looking forward to doing things the open space way with my pal Kaliya. I'll have to think about what I might present. I need to spend some more time with the <a href="http://www.clipperz.net/">Clipper Z</a> guys...maybe I can represent some of the things we talked about (distributed reputation management) when I was in Bologna on their behalf (unless they're coming, of course...).</p>  <p>An aside: I saw the announcement via <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/03/29#puttingTheIInIdentity">Doc</a>, and realized that somewhere along the way <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley's excellent blog</a> had gotten lost from my aggregator. I'm all caught up now, and realize that he's done a couple of posts that I've had rolling around in my head for a while: <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/03/trusting_google.shtml">Google authentication</a> (especially in regards to <a href="http://www.joga.com">Joga</a>) and the simple explanation of <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/03/microid_a_micro.shtml">MicroID</a>. It's great when you can just point to things like that and say &quot;yes, that's pretty much what I was thinking, only written down in a clear and elegant way&quot;. Suffice it to say, Phil's back in the aggregator, and I'm looking forward to spending some time around him and other smart folks at IIW.</p> <!--break-->
