&#8230;whether I use MT 3.0 is far more likely to be dependent on its feature set than its price. But what is the feature set? In the few minutes I've spent trying to find out, I simply can't determine what it has that's different from 2.6, why SixApart thinks I should upgrade, or anything like that.
