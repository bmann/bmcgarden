<p>Once I got over my initial enthusiasm with social networking sites, I started saying a simple phrase: social networking is a <i>feature</i>, not a business plan.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2005/01/linkedin_finall.html">Marc</a>, I see that Reid Hoffman's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> has jumped full force into jobs. The features? Relationship (follow the connections between you and potential employees/employers), References (people connected to you can give references), and Reputation (displays endorsements for employees/employers).</p>

<p>Great stuff, and the latest graphical updates have made LinkedIn nice looking and very usable.</p>

<p>LinkedIn is the one network that I've stuck with. Many of my earlier complaints about it were that &quot;there's nothing to do there&quot;. Well, that's the point. It sits there quietly waiting for the time when you need to search through your business connections.</p><p>And maybe one of these days they'll support Canadian ZIP codes. :P<br />Â </p>
