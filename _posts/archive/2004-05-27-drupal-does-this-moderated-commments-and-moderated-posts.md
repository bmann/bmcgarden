Does anyone know of blogging software that allows blog posts and blog comments to be rated with the comments rising to the top the higher they are rated?  I am thinking of something much like Amazon's book pages where readers can rate both the books and the comments.  The software would have to be flexible.  Alternatively, can anyone out there write or modify existing software to perform these sorts of tasks?   <a href="mailto:Tabarrok@gmu.edu">Email me</a> with leads.  Thanks!

<p>Drupal can do this by turning on moderated comments. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rating">rating contributed module</a> ranks users, not content, but I seem to remember someone had a content rating/ranking system working as well. I'll post something in the Drupal forums and get people to respond.</p>
