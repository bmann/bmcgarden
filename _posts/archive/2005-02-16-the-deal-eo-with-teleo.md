<p>Robert Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/02/14.html#a9426">called</a> Teleo a &quot;potential Skype killer&quot;. Stuart Henshall can be summarized as <a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/archives/001122.html">saying</a> &quot;no presence, no thanks&quot;.</p>

<p>It's a tough world, this middle ground between computers (presence, IM, click-to-call, user interface requirements) and phones (&quot;just works&quot; voice connectivity). But as you can see from just that last statement, the &quot;features&quot; are all on the side of computers. No one raves about placing a call or call forwarding.</p>

<p>But I still want Teleo. Or something like it. I want something built on standards (like SIP) rather than Skype's closed walls. Will and I had a long discussion about this: it comes down to I *know* that other systems interoperate with SIP today, whereas any future development around Skype, I have to wait for Skype to build or bless the usage of.</p>

<p>I want a number that I can point at other telephony devices. I'm held hostage by my Canadian cell phone provider because of the lack of <a title="Local Number Portability for cellular providers doesn't exist in Canada" href="/node/1428">LNP</a>. I'll gladly pay Teleo $3 or $5 per month so that I can have a permanent number.</p>

<p>Except, of course, that that number is still tied to Teleo. I'm unlikely to get it back if they go out of business or I want to switch to another service.</p>

<p>I'd love to trial Teleo, but they currently require downloading and installing a Windows-only application.</p>

<p>I'm going to try my luck with <a href="http://sipphone.com/">SIPphone</a> instead. It even has presence support through <a href="http://sipphone.com/phonegaim/">PhoneGaim</a>, a multi-network IM client and sotfphone in one, although it's Linux and Windows only for now. My wish: that <a href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> manages to integrate SIP-based telephony.</p>

<p>And I still want to buy a number. Just like I can buy a domain. Who can a) sell me one and b) guarantee that I'll be able to switch it to different services?</p>
