<p>Looks like Primus is getting set to compete before <a href="http://www.vonage.ca" title="Vonage in Canada">Vonage</a> and others come to town. The <a href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2004/05/c7804.html">press release</a> from Canada Newswire (brought to my attention by <a href="http://evans.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/4/5/32347.html">Mark Evans</a>) has the scoop:</p>
<ul>
<li>reiterate their <a href="/node/view/1014">new service areas</a></li>
<li>announce 911 service</li>
<li>introduction of an Unlimited Bundle for $45.95 that includes calling anywhere in the US and Canada and all local features</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.primustel.ca/en/residential/talkbroadband/bundles.html">TalkBroadband web pages</a> haven't been updated yet, and there are a few other details in the full post.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The base price of both business and residential service has been lowered <strong>with purchase of voice gateway hardware</strong>. Uh huh. So the base price for residential is $15.95 (as opposed to $19.95, a $4 savings), and the price of the gateway is $139.95. By my math, that means you would need to keep the service for almost 3 <em>years</em> before you made up the purchase cost.</p>

<p>I talked <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1033" title="Vonage now live in Canada">previously</a> about how Vonage's feature set is much stronger, and their unlimited bundle is $45.99. Other than having a jump on Vonage and being a Canadian company, it would seem tough for Primus to compete.</p>

<p>Of course, having chosen Primus for our home service, we're somewhat locked in because of the phone numbers, so perhaps this is what Primus is counting on (hint: that's not good enough). It will be interesting to see about number portability issues, and I may phone Vonage just to ask about this.</p>
