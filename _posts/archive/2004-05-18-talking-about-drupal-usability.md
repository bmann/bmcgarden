One of the big concepts for upcoming versions of Drupal is profiles -- essentially, a bundled set of configuration settings and enabled modules that are pre-set for specific uses.

Some examples include <em>power blogger</em> or <em>community site</em>.

There is a <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Drupal/Usability">Drupal Usability wiki over at urlgreyhot</a> that I've just made a few minor edits to. Probably a quick way to come to some rough consensus and explore some of the concepts around Drupal.
