<p>Well, I'm still in Amsterdam nearing the end of the week but it feels like things are just getting started. I'm actually sitting in de Brakke Grond, site of the <a href="http://drupal.org/conference-amsterdam-2005">DrupalCon</a>, as <a href="http://www.tejasa.com/">Moshe Weitzman</a> walks us through the <a href="http://drupal.org/simpletest">simpletest</a> framework for unit testing in Drupal.</p>  <p>The first <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">OSCON in Europe</a> is just ending. I was disappointed that we couldn't integrate more fully, but Chris Messina and I had a really long and fruitful discussion with Gina Blaber and Margi Levin of O'Reilly's conference team. The team is already looking at planning the next OSCON event in Europe, and I'm looking forward to have a really interesting set of satellite events in partnership with O'Reilly in the future.</p>  <p>And yeah, <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam">BarCampAmsterdam</a>. It starts...well, it started about an hour ago, I'm just still finishing my <strong>last</strong> conference! Yes, things are busy, so busy that I didn't get a chance to bang the drum about some cool hacking stuff that I hope to see accomplished during BarCamp (there's a long story about the lack of Internet connectivity in Amsterdam as well). So, on to the hand waving, or Cool Things I'd Love to See Hackers Build at BarCamp:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>: let's get this implemented in a couple of different systems like <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://joomla.org">Joomla</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. It's Firefox-only right now, so I'm look at <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/">Andre's AJAX team at eBusiness Apps</a> to do the IE compatibility.</li> <li>We had a visit from <a href="http://www.flossusability.org/wiki.pl?JanMuehlig">Jan Muehlig</a> of the <a href="http://www.openusability.org/">Open Usability</a> project. He showed us a demo of a great Flash-based front end for doing card sorts. This is something else that I figure we can integrate into <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, making it very easy to run card sorts.</li> </ul>  <p>More soon, keep an eye on the <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp wiki</a> for news over the weekend. I have to work on my open source cooking skills -- I'm doing a stirfry for hungry BarCampers.</p>
