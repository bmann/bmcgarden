here comes a new CSS layout.
The techniques aren't really new, but maybe the combination of them ;)
My motivation was to create a robust flexible layout for portal software like Plone.

Some highlights:

* Min-max width for IE
* Everything in EM (change your browser font size to see the effect)
* Source ordered
* Full height columns
* Switch between one two or three columns
* Fixed width side-columns
</pre>
