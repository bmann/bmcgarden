This is the (edited) test post from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>. You can post pictures to your blog for supported systems.

Actually, they support the Blogger API, the MetaWeblog API, and ATOM blogs, so that should cover off pretty much everything.

FYI -- this version of Drupal uses the Blogger API. The newest version supports <strong>all</strong> the APIs I mentioned.
