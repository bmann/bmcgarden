The <a href="http://www.europephotobloggers.org/2007meetup">2007 Europe Photoblogger Meetup</a> is happening in Berlin, September 7th to 9th, and the organizers are still looking for sponsors. Paging Yahoo Europe, or perhaps most especially the fine folks at Flickr, you might want to jump on this one.</p><p>I won&#39;t be making it to this, but I am looking forward to <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org">DrupalCon Barcelona</a>, which takes place later in September. I have some ideas brewing on putting together an Enterprise Lounge concept to talk about Drupal... </p>
