A great long rant against FOAF on Tribe made me put my 2Â¢ in:
<blockquote>
Of course, let's spin it around and say, well, FOAF is/can be/should be a profile API. I actually hate the RDF format of FOAF, and have been playing around with a more human-readable, more web-friendly format. So perhaps FOAF is just a data storage/interchange format?<br>
This "profile API" has the concept of relationships, resources, information, etc. etc. -- certain information is requested, and some other permission system/context determines what information is returned. So, we don't care about the underlying storage format.<br>
A parting jab at FOAF: why are there different elements for every single IM system?! What's wrong with this:
[im system = "msn"]myid@msn.com[/im]
</blockquote>
Yes, I'm playing with a format. It's plain-jane XML that mirrors a lot of existing HTML syntax. I think I'll call it...<!--break--> <strong>P</strong>rofile <strong>R</strong>eveals <strong>O</strong>rigins, <strong>F</strong>riends, <strong>I</strong>nterests, <strong>L</strong>ikes/Dislikes, <strong>E</strong>tc.
