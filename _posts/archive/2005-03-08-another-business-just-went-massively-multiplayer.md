<p><a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a> is an amazing little experiment in lending and borrowing money (UK only right now):</p>

<blockquote>
Here’s the really clever bit. An individual lender doesn't lend to an individual borrower because that’s too risky. Instead a lender lends their money across at least fifty Zopa borrowers, and similarly a borrower borrows from a group of Zopa lenders. So the risk is well and truly spread.
