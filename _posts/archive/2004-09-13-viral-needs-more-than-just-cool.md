<p>I seem to be doing this a lot lately. I started commenting on <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/000620.html">Paul Kedrosky's &quot;Is Nothing Viral Anymore?&quot;</a> and then it got really long. So I stuck it here.<br /></p><p>I tend to agree -- cool isn't enough anymore. But part of it is the role of early adopters, I think. We've been suckered too many times, stuck in systems which at first blush seemed cool, but then betrayed us somehow. And not just us, but all the non-techies we convinced to come on board.</p>I seriously regret the series of <acronym title="Yet Another Social Network">YASN</acronym>s that I foisted on a handful of friends. And I won't make that mistake again. As <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/09/entrance_and_ex.html">Jeremy, Jon, and Mark</a> point out -- we want an exit strategy.<br /><br />So, viral still works. But it has to be truly compelling/cool, not too complicated/different, and consistently useful. Oh yes, and all those adjectives have to apply to the regular user, after the geeks have been through and dubbed it worthy.
