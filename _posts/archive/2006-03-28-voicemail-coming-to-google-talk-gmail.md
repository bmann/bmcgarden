<p>I think I just found a feature that's going to be implemented in Google Talk / Gmail real soon now: voicemail.</p>  <p>Try creating a label with the name &quot;voicemail&quot;. I was cleaning up my personal account, where I get my voicemail delivered by email. I had set up a label months ago, and was trying to apply the label to one of the voicemails and got the error &quot;The label name Voicemail is invalid&quot;. Hmmmm. So, I deleted the label, then tried to re-create it with the same name. No go...same error. <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com">Richard</a> quickly verified that he was getting the same error.</p><p>&nbsp;<img vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0" alt="screenshot of Voicemail label error" title="screenshot of Voicemail label error" src="/system/files?file=Picture%208.png" /></p>  <p>Of course, trying to create a label with the name &quot;Chats&quot; gives you a different message -- &quot;System specific names are not allowed. Please try another name.&quot; -- but it likely just means that &quot;Voicemail&quot; isn't truly live in the system yet.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/gmail-for-domains-and-a-few-other-email-solutions">Bryght's switch to Gmail for domains</a> is working really well.&nbsp;</p>
