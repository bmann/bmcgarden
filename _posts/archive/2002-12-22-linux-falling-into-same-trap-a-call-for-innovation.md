An <A Href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,768274,00.asp"> article</a> I saw referenced on <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/12/22/1617210.shtml?tid=106">/.</a>.  It's an interesting take on the innovation problem... especially with regards to software and in particular an OS.  How does one encourage innovation?  I mean, it is extremely tough to get someone to commit something new and most people inherently resist change.  Will the tablet PC cause changes?  Is there another form factor that might?  It's all about use in my opinion... how do you use your PC? How would it be better used...  I don't think I like much of the ole'<a href="http://www.wearcomp.org/defs/">wearable computer</a> stuff... but what's a better form factor and UI?
