<p>Journalist Julian Dibbell set out to do it as a bet: try to earn more money <a href="http://video-games.listings.ebay.com/Internet-Games_Ultima-Online_W0QQfromZR4QQsacategoryZ33886QQsocmdZListingItemListQQsocolumnlayoutZ3QQsocustoverrideZ1">selling virtual objects from the game Ultima Online</a> than as a professional journalist.</p>

<p>He didn't quite succeed, but he did make <a href="http://www.juliandibbell.com/playmoney/2004_04_01_playmoney_archive.html#108200652843059601">almost $4000US in a single month</a> -- or $47K in annualized salary.</p>

<a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/04/journalist_earn.html#comments">Terra Nova</a> has a good listing of what some other professions make, and points out that Dibbell earned more than teachers and drug counselors. Perhaps not a long-term stable profession, but an interesting experiment: virtual goods are worth actual money.</p>
