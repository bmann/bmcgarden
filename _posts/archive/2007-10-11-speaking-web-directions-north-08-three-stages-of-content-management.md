<p>
	I&#39;m happy to announce that I&#39;ll be <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/speakers/#mann">speaking</a> at <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a> and co&#39;s <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">Web Directions North conference</a> this coming January, taking place January 29th through 31st here in Vancouver (with apres conference Whistler trip, of course).</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll be talking about the <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/schedule/#threestagescms">3 Stages of Content Management</a>. I&#39;m tagging stuff in <a href="http://del.icio.us/borismann/wdn08">delicious with WDN08</a> -- please send me your links if you have something relevant to add. Yes, I&#39;ll be mentioning Drupal, but I&#39;ll mainly go through why/when/how you&#39;ll be diving into an actual content management &quot;system&quot; vs. straight up HTML pages (people still do that?!?) and some of the different tools and techniques, as well as the reason why you might want to go to a dynamic system.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://north.webdirections.org/sponsorship/">WDN</a> is still looking for sponsorship, and of course you should definitely attend if building websites is at all in your future. Dave&#39;s presence here in Vancouver is finally starting to be felt (which Dave? oh, you mean <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">the CSS Zen Garden guy?</a> He lives in Vancouver?!?) and the conference last year was excellent.</p>
