<p>Currently I'm using <a href="http://allconsuming.net/">AllConsuming</a> for books, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for bookmarks and Morten's <a href="http://foaf.dk/hosting/">FOAF hosting</a> to grab my wishlist from Amazon.</p>

<p>As these services allow me to take away my augmented data in an easily processable format (XML/RDF) it means that as a hacker I can do Cool Things. But, more importantly, as an end user I don't have to worry about the pointy brackets: I key in some data and as well as an enriching my online experience, it also gives me a URL, a RESTful access point to my data, at which I can point other services. This is the Unix pipe metaphor extended to the web: small specialized services that can be plumbed together to create interesting applications.</p>
