<p>Dave Winer talks about some strategies for building a tech center. I agree with him on programming, or perhaps technical literacy. Just like journalism would teach many skills around critical thinking, writing, and so on.</p>
<p>Computer Science, of course, is not actually a programming degree. Depending on which institution you go to, it will lean more towards math &amp; algorithms or towards a software engineering direction.</p>
<p>I ended up knowing how to program with my computer science degree from UVic, but I learned more during my co-op terms and afterwards on my own time about the craft of programming.</p>
<p>And that's the problem: we haven't decided whether programming is something technicians do (and thus, not taught at university), that engineers do (not yet enough predictability or bridge-building-like stability, I would say), or simply math &amp; algorithms (the current state of computer science).</p>
