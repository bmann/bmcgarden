title: Boot & Fix over Net?

As I write this, I'm in a comp lab at BCIT.  My iMac's hard drive has gone down and TechTool Pro cannot fix or even discover the problem.  I will have to bring home a technician's disk with DiskWarrior after work tomorrow and solve the problem.

Even in MacOS 9 the Mac could remote boot over the net, as can many other OSes.  Could it be possible for Apple to setup a remote-boot service via Akamai that would allow boot-over-net and disk diagnostic support?  After all, if a Linux implementation can fit onto a floppy disk, surely a simple boot and diagnostic could be easy to download and run over broadband?  It could be a .Mac service... might even make .Mac slightly valuable to people.

Will only get to read the responses to this thread tomorrow at work. :(
