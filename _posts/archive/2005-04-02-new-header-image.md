<p>I swapped out the &quot;Boris in sunglasses&quot; image in my header here. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/7922292/">picture there now</a> was taken by <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris Krug</a> at the <a href="http://www.bryght.com/events/massive-2005" title="Bryght Vancouver Massive 2005 Event">Bryght Massive 2005 booth</a>.</p>

<p>Several people at the <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=282">March 30th Vancouver Beercasting</a>, including <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com">Michael Tippett of Now Public</a> mentioned that the sunglasses image was scary. It made me look intimidating. Actually, <a href="http://www.shanesworld.ca">Shane</a> said this a long time ago. So, hopefully this image, of me talking to someone and not staring directly at you, will be less intimidating.</p>
