<p>My dad, <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com">Horst Mann</a>, turned 70 yesterday. He has an old Canon digital camera, my hand me down 15&quot; Powerbook G4, and talks to his daughter and grand daughter in Italy using Skype and video.</p><p>He is an &quot;Old Skool&quot; Flickr member. I kicked him off my home server hosting using Gallery, and he&#39;s been a Flickr community member since about March 2004. Yep, that&#39;s &#39;04, March. On Flickr, he&#39;s known as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opa">Opa</a>, which means &quot;grandpa&quot; in German.<br /></p><p>As of yesterday, he and my mom both have Facebook accounts. They both use <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">NetNewsWire</a> to keep up to date via RSS with a variety of sites, including this one. Subscribing to new sources is hard, but then clicking through every link in a blog entry and reading every resulting page takes some time, so I&#39;m not sure they have room for more. They blog occasionally, but uploading pictures to Flickr seems the easiest way to tell a story. </p><p>Dad has a cellphone, some sort of Motorola from Telus. His phone number is actually set to 100 Mile House, since my parents have a cabin up there, and it lets him do a few things like (painfully) text people and make phone calls using a cell phone antenna on the roof. He&#39;s seen me using a variety of Nokia phones to easily take pictures and upload them directly to Flickr on the go using <a href="http://www.shozu.com">ShoZu</a>. But, we know all about <a href="/blog/bmann/the-travesty-of-canadian-mobile-data-rates">Canadian mobile data rates</a> and how that&#39;s impossible for &quot;regular people&quot; to afford.&nbsp;</p><p>70. My dad is 70. Growing up, he knew all about technology. He was the guy that taught me a lot. He taught courses on AppleWorks and the Apple IIe. We got cool tech at home earlier than most (I mean, a <a href="http://lowendmac.com/pb/portable.shtml">Mac Portable</a>, upgraded to 2MB!!! of RAM).</p><p>So, on this day after my dad&#39;s 70th birthday, I&#39;m throwing out a request. We&#39;ve got a lot to learn from people using technology, of all ages and backgrounds. I&#39;d like to see my dad get some cool tools or services to kick the tires on. He&#39;s going to do the Camino, the pilgrim&#39;s walk in Spain, for the second time next year, so perhaps mobile devices would be particularly appropriate.<br /></p><p>Leave a comment, get in touch, or even just head over and <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/birthday-wishes-for-horst/">leave a comment wishing him happy birthday</a>. Happy birthday, dad, and thanks for teaching me so much.<br /></p>
