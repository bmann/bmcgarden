<p>Looks like I am going to have to start following the <a href="http://acmqueue.com/">ACM Queue</a> more closely -- here's a great piece on <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=87&page=1">SIP/IM</a>. Read it and tell me that SIP married with IM is still a good idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=93">This other article</a> talks up the benefits of <acronym title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</acronym>. Yes, it is written by someone from Jabber, so read it with a grain of salt. Of course, the only remaining opposition is from the SIP/IM folks, and the former article pretty nicely pokes holes in that.</p>

<p>I guess to round out this discussion, something from the SIP/IM camp that picks apart XMPP would be good. Anyone have some pointers?</p>
