Richard wants to be number one for <a href="http://www.movableblog.com/archives/2004/07/07/xoduszero" title="Xoduszero">Xoduszero</a>. Help him out by throwing a couple of links his way.

I don't know if other people will use SEO "scam" techniques. I still haven't finished my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/search-engine-voodoo">Search Engine Voodoo</a> series, and it's hard to explain to people what it is that most SEO isn't (or rather, how to accomplish, which usually means difficult stuff like refactoring your code and URL naming). Good content, good code, lots of interlinking. So get linking, give it one for the gipper.
