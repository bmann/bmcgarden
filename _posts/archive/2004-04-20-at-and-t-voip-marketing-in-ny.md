<p>Andy links to the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=SVBIZINK1.story&STORY=/www/story/04-19-2004/0002153898&EDATE=MON+Apr+19+2004,+08:05+AM">press release</a> announcing AT&T's entry into the NY market with their CallVantage VoIP service. A good analysis of how both education and promotion still need to be tied together, and how AT&T is doing a great job of both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What Dave Dorman has done is stepped up and said that to win the battle for the market, they have to educate the market about VoIP. If you notice, since AT&T announced entry into the space, the VoIP news noise level has increased. Smart marketers know they have to lead the category, not just get news for themselves.  </p>

<p>If the AT&T product is as good as the marketing, then the other carriers have to start to look over both shoulders...and then figure out how to market better. </p>
