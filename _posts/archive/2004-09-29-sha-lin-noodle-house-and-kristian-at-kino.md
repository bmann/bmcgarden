We went last time way back in February when Kate had just arrived in Vancouver, with Mary and Evan.</p><br clear="all" /><!--break--><p>The dumplings were as good as we remembered, but we couldn't find the garlic gai-lan (Chinese broccoli) on the menu anymore, so had to settle for regular broccoli. Still tasty, and nice and garlicky.</p><p>I didn't remember how big the dumplings were, so also ended up with a hot &amp; sour soup. Very tasty, not too thick (lots of places dump cornstarch in until the broth is more like mud) and lots and lots of good &quot;stuff&quot; in the broth: fresh cilantro on top, oyster mushrooms, tofu.</p><p>Check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/tags/shalinnoodlehouse/show/">slideshow </a>to see all the food.</p><p>Pleasantly full, and with a few dumplings left over for later, we headed off to the Kino Cafe to listen to Kristian perform with the Ian Ross Quartet -- jazz-y pleasant listening music + beer + lots of conversation.</p>
