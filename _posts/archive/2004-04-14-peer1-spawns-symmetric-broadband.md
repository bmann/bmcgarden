<p><a href="http://www.peer1.net">Peer1</a> today announced that they're getting into the VoIP game:</p>

<blockquote>
Symmetric will be focused solely on providing Internet Protocol to carriers and VoIP companies. Utilizing and leveraging Peer 1 Network’s existing co-location facilities and high performance IP network, Symmetric will set up VoIP gateways in all of Peer 1’s locations: Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal, as well as New York, Seattle and San Jose. The existing infrastructure will greatly accelerate the time to market.

<p>In many ways, this is what I have been predicting -- wholesale termination services, meaning that other businesses can start offering VoIP services without having to worry about running highly reliable gateways.</p>
