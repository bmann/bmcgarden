<p>I just bought a <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/linksys-wrt54g">LinkSys WRT54G</a> and I'll still likely buy one of these as part of my travel kit. Integration into iTunes! Printer sharing! Heck, with a USB connection, you could easily hook up all sorts of home networking dongles if Apple opens up some of the specs (I know, I know -- perhaps too much to hope for).</p>
