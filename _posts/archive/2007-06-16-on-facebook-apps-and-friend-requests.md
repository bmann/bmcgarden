So...while I am experimenting with Facebook Apps myself (see http://apps.facebook.com/bmannconsulting -- but really, that just allows login to this website), I am unlikely to add arbitrary Facebook App X. The only ones I&#39;m interested in are ones that connect out to the Internet: random little apps that live only inside FB are less interesting to me. And actually, ones that let users add content but then you HAVE to be a member to even see the content...yeah, yeah...I get the viral thing, it&#39;s just annoying!<br /><br />That means a lot of &quot;ignore this&quot; from me.<br /><br />Also....I&#39;m only adding friends that I&#39;ve actually met in person OR spent a significant amount of time interacting with online. This is a long standing rule of mine that I&#39;ve used for years.<br /><br />If you&#39;re a friend of a friend that I&#39;ve met once or twice: don&#39;t feel bad, we&#39;re &quot;connected&quot; through that friend of mine. That&#39;s how these social network things work.
