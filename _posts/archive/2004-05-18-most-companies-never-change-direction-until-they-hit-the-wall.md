We&#8217;re still clearly in a transition phase, where more and more companies will join the bandwagon, but it&#8217;s interesting to see the raise of the negative effects of sticking with bad habits vs. the benefits of adopting new rules as a driver for the adoption of web standards. Most companies never change direction until they hit the wall, as do many politicians who lack vision. It seems like a common trait of human nature.
