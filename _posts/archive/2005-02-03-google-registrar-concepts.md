<p>I've been thinking about this since I heard the news, and CircleID's <a href="http://www.circleid.com/article/930_0_1_0_C/">10 Things Google Could do as a Domain Registrar</a> post made me remember to post.</p>

<p>Chalk these ideas up in the &quot;rumours/predictions&quot; list, but I think all of the thoughts below are ones that &quot;make sense&quot; for Google.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>There are some good points in CircleID's list, and I tend to agree with #2 (Domains for <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> hosting) and #10 (Free domain + website with automatic adsense). Actually, I think these two amount to the same thing -- what is Blogger besides a hosted CMS/blogging tool?</p>

<p>As I stated in my <a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/180">Picking a Blogging Platform</a> post, the first thing that anyone using Blogger needs to do is get a domain name so that they can control the future of their content.</p>

<p>This creates a barrier to the continued ease of use of Blogger. <a href="http://www.blogware.com">Blogware</a> lets you start with a free subdomain (subdomain.blogware.com) and then easily point a domain at it later. It would make sense that Google would offer something similar for people wanting to move off their subdomain.blogspot.com address.</p>

<p>Yahoo has a similar strategy, although they don't have a blogging platform. They offer domain registration, DNS management, and their Yahoo Stores are widely used as an easy e-commerce platform.</p>

<p>I could also see Google &quot;re-inventing&quot; domain registration/DNS management. The only good interfaces for this that I have seen also carry premium pricing (<a href="http://www.easydns.com">EasyDNS</a> comes to mind -- fantastic, first-class DNS management, service, and uptime, but high costs). Google could pull a &quot;Gmail&quot; and create an innovative interface that is also low-cost. Heck, where's the 1-click shopping equivalent in the domain world?</p>

<p>Speaking of Gmail, this could also be pointing towards a premium version of that: rather than just forwarding, allow people to host their email directly on Google's systems.</p>

<p>Probably enough <acronym title="Stupid Wild Ass Guesses">SWAG</acronym>s for the day :P</p>
