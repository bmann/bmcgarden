<p>It was my great pleasure to <a href="http://www.clipperz.net/users/marco/blog/2006/02/27/clipperz_meets_boris_mann">meet</a> the three guys from <a href="http://www.clipperz.net">ClipperZ</a> (The image is a little blurry, but that's because I had them shout &quot;Identity 2.0&quot; when I took the picture :P).</p>  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/103182657/"><img width="240" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="180" border="0" align="left" alt="ClipperZ in Bologna" title="ClipperZ in Bologna" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/103182657_74d3a3e0a9_m.jpg" /></a>  <p>We sat down for several hours to discuss Identity 2.0 and some of their thoughts on blog owner centric vs. comment maker centric systems, talking mainly about <a href="http://www.sxore.com">SXORE</a> (Marco has a <a href="http://www.clipperz.net/users/marco/blog/2006/02/14/sxore_reasons_i_dont_like_it">post with SXORE feedback</a>)  and <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a>. No comments from the SXORE team on that post, although <a href="http://bryanrieger.com/">Bryan Rieger</a> found it. Go Vancouver people!</p>  <p>In any case, they are thinking about portable reputation (or maybe federated reputation would be a better phrase) as an initial application that can be built on top of Identity 2.0 systems. A reputation manager (a reputation provider? store?) would support multiple identity systems for authentication, and also share reputation with other reputation managers. This would initially be based on some very simple metrics, like perhaps whether or not a comment was approved, but certainly could support multiple other values (which gets quickly into a discussion about designing karma systems, perhaps, although it would depend on the feedback loops involved). Definitely subscribe to their <a href="http://www.clipperz.net/blog">blog</a> if you want to keep up with what these guys are up to.</p>  <p>The other exciting thing I found was that here was a new &quot;Web 2.0&quot; style startup company based in Italy that had a lot more in common with Vancouver or San Francisco than anything else I had seen up to that point in Italy. We discussed the difficulties and benefits of a distributed team (although they are all in Italy, they live in different towns), and the usual roundup of tools -- they tried Basecamp but ended up using <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a>, their user interaction diagrams are in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, we discussed <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> vs. Skype bookmarked chats, or perhaps a Jabber multi-user chatroom.</p>  <p>It's nice to see such interesting things happening in Europe, and I have more of an interest in cross-pollination with European companies and clients than I do in jumping down into the scrum in Silicon Valley. I'm already scheming what the next European event will be: perhaps a <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels">BarCamp Brussels</a>? Could be organized around <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/">Euro OSCON 2006</a> at the end of September 2006 (the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/euos2006/create/e_sess/">Call for Participation deadline is March 6th).</a></p> <!--break-->
