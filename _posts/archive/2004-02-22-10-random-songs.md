<p>You are invited to list the first 10 songs in your music library when put on random:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Guns in the Ghetto</em>, by Randy's All Stars (Impact)</p>
<p>An import disc that Kate bought at the <a href="http://www.stevex.org/restaurants/ShowRestaurant.aspx?ID=193">Black Tomato</a> in Ottawa.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hola' Hovito</em>, by Jay-Z (The Blueprint)</p>
<p>This song promptly eared a one-star rating, never to be seen in my play list again.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Swimming in Your Ocean</em>, by Crashtest Dummies (God Shuffled His Feet)</p>
<p>I like Crashtest Dummies perhaps because the lead singer has a low bassy voice that I can emulate. I consistently would sing <em>The Superman Song</em> at top volume while on watch during my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/80">Class Afloat trip</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Comfortably Numb</em>, by Pink Floyd (The Wall)</p>
<p>Why does this song (and this album) still seem so relevant?</p></li>
<li><p><em>So Hysterically</em>, by Charley Beck (Life's Pleasures?)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charleybeck.com/">Charley</a> performed at a couple of events with the <a href="http://www.picklecatz.com">Picklecatz</a>. Support independent musicians!</p>
<li><p><em>I Miss You (Album Version)</em>, by Björk (Telegram)</p>
<p>Icelandic pop, who woulda thunk it? We used to listen to this a lot in university.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tuning In (Dub Mix)</em>, by Groove Armada (Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub))</p>
<p>Excellent funky electronic beats.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Jealous Kind</em>, by Joe Cocker (Joe Cocker's Greatest Hits)</p>
<p>Everybody needs classic rock.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mystic Eyes</em>, by Them (Classic Rock - Rock Renaissance II)</p>
<p>But how much classic rock is too much?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Running Three</em>, by Tykwer, Klimek, Heil (Soundtrack: Run Lola Run)</p>
<p>Great movie, with catchy music that puts hooks in your ears. Maybe I'm just a sucker for German-accented English...</p></li>

<p>So, unlike the instructions, I did do a modification. A lot of the music that is in our library is arguably Kate's music (since most of the 750 CDs we have were hers to begin with). I have my own custom smart playlist, which filters out a bunch of genres (Classical, Country, etc.) and some artists (Ani DiFranco). As well, as per the comment above, anything that is rated below 3 stars is also filtered out. That still leaves 5,607 songs. I think of that as "my" music library.</p>
