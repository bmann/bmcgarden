Working in a Mac retail store, we have a shelf of retro games that haven't been sold but are kept in inventory.  There are a dozen copies of Master of Orion 2 alone, as well as Hexen, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and more.

Do you think that these games will hold any value as collectors items some day?
