The <a href="http://www.crn.com/weblogs/stevegillmor/2003/06/01/01.asp#42320">entire post from Steve Gillmor</a>:
<blockquote>
Bill Gates finally takes this public, courtesy of the Wall Street Journal's D conference and <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000114.html">leaked blogging</a>.
<em>"Microsoft is also betting on mesh networks -- Gates believes that by spreading WiFi backhall among large numbers of clients, WiFi will facilitate broadband for everyone that may <strong>serve to replace cellular networks under many circumstances</strong>. Gates predicts mesh networks will be mainstream in the next 5 years and he's presumably already looking to build software to address the problems associated with the multiplicity of base stations."</em><br>
<br>
Now we'll wait for the other part of this shoe to drop.

The bolded section is my emphasis. OK, so MS plans to build wireless/mesh networking into every product. This suggests a couple of things.<!--break-->
<ol>
<li>MS is going to go up against service providers and/or vendors like NT, Cisco, etc.</li>
<li>Two -- you think the recent Blaster worm was bad?!?</li>
</ol>
I don't even want to imagine how bad it could be if all Windows machines were automatically part of a mesh, through which a worm could spread unchecked...
