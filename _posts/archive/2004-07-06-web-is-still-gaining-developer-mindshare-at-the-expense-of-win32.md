<p>I've been thinking about the rise of the web as an application
platform for a while. But what hadn't occurred to me until I read
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Spolsky's essay</a> last week is this, which I think is quite
remarkable: Microsoft totally fucked up when they took aim at
Netscape. It wasn't <em>Netscape</em> that was a threat to Windows as an
application platform, it was the web itself.</p>

<p>They spent all that time, money, and development effort on IE,
building a browser monopoly and crushing Netscape -- but to what
avail? Here we are, and the web is still gaining developer
mindshare at the expense of Win32.</p>

<p>Microsoft is still hedging it's bets. It sunk money into WebTV and is still struggling with smartphones and handhelds. But if the web wins, Microsoft loses.</p>
