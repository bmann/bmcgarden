	The great thing is that with one (X)HTML document, you can have a slide show, a printer-friendly version, and a screen presentation. I put markup and CSS examples right there in the document, ready to be printed, and simply hide them in the slide show. In some cases, I printed out the file for handouts, and then used the exact same file for the slide show. It was very, very handy. <cite><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/24/slide-show-beta/">Eric&#39;s Archived Thoughts: Slide Show Beta</a></cite></blockquote>

	Eric Meyer is actually talking about a feature of Opera called <a href="http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/operashow/index.dml">Opera Show</a>, but it describes what he has now accomplished in CSS, XHTML, and a little JavaScript: a browser-based slideshow that is just plain code underneath, with no plug-ins. It looks and feels like PowerPoint...except it isn&#39;t, and it can be used anywhere. Check out Eric&#39;s <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/slideshow/test.html">test file</a>. Viewing source on that page shows a thing of beauty.</p>

	Dear Apple/Steve: please make Keynote export to this &quot;format&quot; automatically.</p>
