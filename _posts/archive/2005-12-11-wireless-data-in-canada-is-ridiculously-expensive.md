<p>Mentioning his on the road week at Les Blogs, <a href="http://paolo.evectors.it/2005/12/11.html#a2700">Paolo Valdemarin reports</a> that 3G access with his phone costs 0,75 eurocent/kb = 7,6 Euros per Mb.</p>  <p>I would happily pay that price, especially for the approximately 300kbps speed of 3G. How much does wireless cost in Canada? Well, only Fido/Rogers have GPRS, while Bell and Telus have the ridiculous 1X no SIM card lock in nonsense. If you don't have a data plan, GPRS costs $30 CDN / MB, or 30 cents/kb. So, uploading one picture from my 1.3MP cameraphone costs about $9. Ridiculous!</p>  <p>Luckily, I have a grandfathered Fido plan that lets me use unlimited data for $50 / month. I try and use it as much as possible to get my moneys worth. Darren earlier reported what happens when you <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2005/10/gprs-is-a-joke.html">try data without a plan</a>.</p>
