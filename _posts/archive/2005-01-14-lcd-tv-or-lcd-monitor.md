<p>Should I get an LCD TV for my <a href="/node/1413">Media Mini Mac</a>?</p><p>To tell the truth, I&#39;m a little confused between the two. The two categories are definitely merging. The main thing seems to be that units that call themselves LCD <em>TVs</em> have low native monitor resolution.</p><p>But, they tend to be cheaper than LCD monitors. Harry pointed out the Dell W2600 to me, which is 26&quot;, has two TV tuners (so it can do picture-in-picture), and even some basic built-in speakers, for $1999 -- $100 more than the 23&quot; Benq, with 3&quot; and tons of features.</p><!--break--><p>Here&#39;s what Trusted Reviews had to say:</p><blockquote>There&#39;s a lot to say about the W2600, but before I get into the detail let me say that this is the best LCD TV that I&#39;ve ever seen. This comes as something of a surprise considering that Dell is definitely a computer company rather than a consumer electronics one, but as Bob Dylan once said, the times, they are a-changin&#39;. <cite><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=936">Trusted Reviews: Dell W2600 26&quot; LCD TV</a></cite></blockquote><p>Flip over to the full article to read all the specs -- it has a total of 10 input options, comes with a ton of different cables, has a good remote -- heck, it even has a video <em>out</em> connection, so you could run it back out to a PVR.</p><p>Hmmm...I&#39;ve sworn up and down that I wouldn&#39;t want to buy a Dell computer, but their TVs might just do it for me.</p>
