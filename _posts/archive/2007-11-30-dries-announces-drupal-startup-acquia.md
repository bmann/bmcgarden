<p>I just did my first post to the Raincity Studios blog, about <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/thestandard/dries-buytaert-announces-his-post-university-gig-acquia-a-drupal-startup">Dries announcing his Drupal startup Acquia</a>.</p>

<p>I really am pleased for Dries. I know that he's had a number of different offers and ideas that he's had to think through. Doing your own thing is exciting. Doing it well-funded is even more exciting :P</p>

<p>I think there are a number of different business models around open source that need more examples and experimentation. I've seen a lot of companies trying to make installing open source applications easier, but that's a "do once" operation that, to me, is not particularly high value.

<p>Distilling the knowledge of lots of smart people into a focused distribution is a great thing, and upgrading / maintaining an installation over time is the much harder thing that I'd like to see more solutions around.</p>

<p>So, Dries, <a href="http://buytaert.net/acquia-my-drupal-startup">congrats on Acquia</a>. I think we've got a few more adventures to go on together, and I'm looking forward to it.</p>
