A listing at NCIX shows a new AMD processor model - the Athlon XP 2500+ Barton, a 333FSB CPU based on AMD's brand-spanking-new chip.

My own effort to assemble the Multimedia PC of the West was previously including a 333FSB 2600+, listed at $500 Canadian at NCIX.com.  If this 2500+ chip is not a ghost, it is listed at $200 less, a massive savings for a PC, yet somehow to critics only a "meager" cut to the new iMacs.

This would definitely allow me to increase the multimedia factor in Multimedia-PC
