<blockquote>
I am on the second highest level of Computer Science education possible. I have learnt little in school. Where are the professors and classes that pertain to real world computing? Why are all the gurus and technology <em>innovators</em> outside of educational institutions? Where are the Mark Pilgrim, Phil Ringnalda, Joel Spolsky and Jakob Neilsons of the educational world? Why are we teaching classes about Ada and Cobol <em>instead</em> of classes on (developing) programming standards and .NET? Let me give you some examples.

<p>I have a Computer Science degree, and I absolutely learned everything useful outside of school. Luckily, <a href="http://www.uvic.ca">my university</a> had co-op programs, so I got to work at three different companies and learn three different skill sets. It also directly led to my <a href="http://www.nortelnetworks.com">first job</a>.</p>
