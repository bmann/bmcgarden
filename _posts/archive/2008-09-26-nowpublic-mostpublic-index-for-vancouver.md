<p><a href="http://www.nowpublic.com">NowPublic</a> just released a <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/mostpublic/list/vancouver">MostPublic Index for Vancouver</a> that lists 20 people ... and I come in at #3.  The background for how the list is calculated is <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/mostpublic/list/info">here</a>, with the rough text below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NowPublic’s formula gauges influence and <strong>“publicness”</strong> across four categories, including:</p> <ul><li>Online Visibility</li><li>Presence on User-Generated Content and Social Networking Sites</li><li>Interactivity and Accessibility</li><li>The “R” Factor: Presence on Microblogging Platforms (Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.)</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do I think of this? Well, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a> (as the #1 spot) got interviewed for the <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=d7ea6747-7585-45f5-8e95-f97c30de66c2">article in the Vancouver Sun</a> and pointed out longevity: Darren figures he's been blogging since about 2002. I'm in that range, with my permanent presence occuring around that time, although I think I seriously started posting online about a year or so earlier, trying different systems (the <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/node/1">very first post on this site</a> is dated 2002-11-09).</p>

<p>But wait, what do I think of this?</p>

<p>Well, it just so happens that I still write this blog for me. Most of the topics here are about tech, or pointing at things I want to highlight or tell people about. People still come up to me in person and say "sometimes I don't know what you're talking about" -- this is my personal scratchpad, and it's for me. I've tried back and forth to be more personal here, but I tend not to be. I'm giving another kick at that can on a <a href="http://livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a> site and I write recipes and talk about cooking on my <a href="http://foodlikethat.com">FoodLikeThat.com</a> site.</p>

<p>There are comments on the <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=d7ea6747-7585-45f5-8e95-f97c30de66c2">Vancouver Sun</a> and <a href="http://techvibes.com/blog/vancouver-20-most-visible-individuals-on-the-web">Techvibes</a> in the vein of "these people have no lives" and so on.</p>

<p>No problem. I do this thing for me, and it sometimes has effects like connecting me to people that I would not otherwise have met. I'd like to do more exploratory writing and thinking here, but I've been finding it hard. I'll keep writing - or not writing - as I please. I hope that some of you find it interesting at times, and I enjoy any comments and interaction that I do get.</p>

<p>Congrats to the other MostPublic'rs. See you online...</p>
