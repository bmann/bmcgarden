<blockquote>
<p>I'm in the process of evaluating several weblog solutions for building a <em>corporate weblogs farm</em>. In other words, I'm looking for a solution that would allow a company, with a simple (if not single) software installment on its existing web platform, to host any number of internal and/or external weblogs.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I ended up comparing <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a>'s <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> 3 and <a href="http://pmachine.com/">pMachine</a>'s <a href="http://pmachine.com/expressionengine/">ExpressionEngine</a> 1.0. The following is not a full fledged comparison of both products, but I thought it might be of interest for other people as I came out with some interesting differences that might help someone else make their mind about them.</p>

<p>A good overview of <acronym title="MovableType">MT</acronym> vs. <acronym title="Expression Engine">EE</acronym>, in this case for their usefulness in a corporate setting. pMachine was my first true weblog system. I had been using <a href="http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/">phpWebSite</a> for my tech news, but found that I was posting more often (almost exclusively) to this little pMachine-driven section. I also remember talking to Rick Ellis about a pMachine hosting platform, but he was in the midst of setting up his company and planning for EE. The rest of the story is well-known &mdash; I use <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> and think it's a great platform, and it works great for corporate needs.</p>
