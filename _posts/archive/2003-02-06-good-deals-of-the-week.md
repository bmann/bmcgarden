This week, I've discovered what a lot of other people know - the <a href="http://www.samsung.ca:3304/cgi-bin/nasecabc/en/b2c/product/product_detail.jsp?LoginFlag=NO&prod_id=GH19ASCS">Samsung 191n 19" LCD</a> is an incredible deal.  Analog VGA input only, no DVI or ADC, but we have it for $1300.  Its colour quality is very good, and it can rotate on its stand, letting you do portrait view, just like in the good ole days with the Radius Portrait Display.

$1300 is also amazingly cheap - that's $200 more than the Apple 17", or $100 per inch.  Compare to the Apple 20" which is $2050, or around $313 per inch difference to the 17".

And the Samsung 19" with a DVI port is $2300 US, way more expensive than the 191n
