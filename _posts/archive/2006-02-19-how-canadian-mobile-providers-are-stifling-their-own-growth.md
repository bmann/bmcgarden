<p>I'm currently still in Torino, Italy, although I'm heading out to Milan, then Bologna tomorrow, and will be in Brussels by the end of the week in time for <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>.</p>  <p>I'm writing a bit about mobile technologies here in Italy over on <a title="Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics" href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com">2010.dailyvancouver.com</a> (check the <a href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com/topic/tech-talk">Tech Talk section</a>). I've got a Vodaphone SIM for my Nokia 6630 with UMTS-based 3G service (around 350kbps) and the experience has been fantastic.</p>  <p>So, while we had our <a href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com/topic/torino-2006/olympics-and-web-2-0-symposium">symposium</a>, the relative maturity of the European vs. Canadian mobile technologies certainly did come up. One example I used was how there is a mobile data plan here that gives you 9GB of transfer for 40EU. On Fido, which is my provider back home, this would cost $270,000 based on the listed per MB charges of $30. Actually, I did the calculation in my head initially and everyone was shocked/amused by the figure of $27,000...and then we figured out we were still an order of magnitude off!</p>  <p>So I can sympathise with <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2006/02/19/when-does-unlimited-mean-unlimited/">Alec Saunders' experience with the Rogers &quot;unlimited&quot; plan</a> which is definitely not unlimited:  </p><blockquote> Rogers used to be an innovator in the Canadian market. This kind of behaviour smacks of clueless, and deliberately deceitful, lawyers and marketing people trying to pull a fast one on customers. Rogers needs to fix my bill, and then offer a proper unlimited data plan -- one that recognizes the reality of the advanced data devices they're pushing in the marketplace.</blockquote>  <p>I am &quot;lucky&quot; to have a grandfathered unlimited data plan from Fido, which <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> was also lucky enough to get -- it's $50CDN per month, but it's also the <strong>only</strong> way to experiment with rich mobile services in Canada; anything else would bankrupt you within months. Hence, Canadian mobile providers are actually stifling their own growth.</p><p>I'm going to add my voice to Alec's: Rogers, use the Fido brand as the place to try out innovation. And yes, I'm happy to help :P<br /> </p>
