<ul><li>every event should make a list of &quot;fun URLs&quot; that get thought up at events -- and then registered, like <a href="http://www.myurlistoolong.com">http://www.myurlistoolong.com</a> </li><li>there were are as many great presentations that I couldn&#39;t make it to as I did attend</li><li>we need to find a kit to stress-test wireless networks ahead of time...or revert to wired connections</li><li>I got to talk to many great people...and also missed spending time with others (too many to mention...but <a href="http://elearningskinny.com/">Zug</a> is definitely in my thoughts)</li><li>Google needs to point out who the heck is going to talk about identity issues (from technical interop to privacy); also, say things in public about your logging policy </li><li>every time I talk about microformats I passionately argue the opposite case; they are a great solution for putting mixed, structured content into one big text blob (i.e. a blog post with an event, a location, some people, and a resume); they are not a great solution for passing structured data between systems and/or for presenting a pure feed of one type of data (events, people, etc.)<br /></li><li>OpenID does simple sign on great today -- go ahead and implement it; <a href="http://sxip.org">SXIP</a> is a better solution, since it also covers profiles and personas. <a href="http://blame.ca">Dick</a> and company: get us a stable implementation and put all your code in one place and we will implement the h*ck out of it; while you&#39;re at it, unite the tribes, extend OpenID to v3 or whatever the hell we have to wait for until it has profile/persona support too, and make sure we have an upgrade path and/or compatibility with SAML. Thanks. </li><li>The Vancouver tech community is awesome. So awesome that we get fun friends from the US coming up to visit us. We should get together more often, but perhaps with a little less intensity, &#39;cause I&#39;m exhausted.<br /></li><li>We need to do a <strong>Foo(d) Camp</strong> </li><li>Bill MacEwen&#39;s <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">Workspace</a> is a great space, and he&#39;s put a ton of work into it; lots of people are excited about using the space, I&#39;ll even be renting a room on Tuesday; I applaud him and his business, I still wish we could do a non-profit version </li><li>I&#39;m kicking myself for not playing with/implementing VoIP sooner; why the heck am I bound by the shackles of the stupid phone system? <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> is awesome, thanks to George of <a href="http://netvoice.ca">Netvoice</a>...I hope you will make my (telephony) life and that of other local Vancouver geeks better in the days to come </li><li>I like to BBQ </li></ul>
