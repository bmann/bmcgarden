<p>I've been talking for a while about knowledge gardening, as it applies to running wikis, large community sites, or other interactive, collaborative knowledge stores. I really like the metaphor -- it implies a fertile ground for organic systems to grow, but also a gardener to take care of the weeds that inevitably grow. Translation: you need a site mom/gardener/etc. to get the most out of your shared space.</p>
<p>Tagging is new to the party, and we're still figuring out how to use it. Jordan Willms (as well as creating lots of great Drupal code) has been thinking a lot about mixing tags with a little more control: gardened hierarchical folksonomy. Follow the link to check out his ground rules:</p>

	<p>What I propose is a concept called <strong>'gardened hierarchical folksonomy'</strong>. The basic idea is that you let the site visitors build and construct the taxonomy tree. While this sounds like pure anarchy, it can be effectively controlled with a few ground rules:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> WordPress is <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/06/29/bugmaster/">appointing Bug Gardeners</a>. Pretty much the same thing, except I don't know if a bug or knowledge is the easier thing to garden :P</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.43places.com">43 Places</a>, the <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com">Robots</a> have been dealing with something very similar as they try to help people organize all the worlds places -- a hierarchy of pre-made places with users iterating over and filling in the gaps, and then going back and fixing mistakes and making adjustments.</p>
