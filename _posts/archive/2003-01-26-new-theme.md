<p>I imagine that most of you see the default theme for this site -- the "notables" one that I created.</p>
<p>I try and wander through the forums and bug reports at <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal.org</a> (the code that runs this site) every so often, because I'm still excited about where it's headed.</p>
<p>I've given lots of feedback about removing hard-coded tables and just using CSS for presentation, instead of a complicated "theme-ing" system. Recently, somebody went to a lot of work and put together a tableless theme that uses CSS for presentation, all nicely documented. You can grab it from the <a href="http://drupal.org/project">Drupal downloads page</a> if you run your own Drupal-powered site.</p>
<p>Yes -- I <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1082">complained about the downloads page</a>, but (frighteningly enough) it's still better than what was there before.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm mucking with the themes as we speak, so changing your theme could be hazardous to your health... If you want to try out the tableless theme (Evan -- it's got lots of <strong>::</strong>'s, so you'll like it...), you can click on <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=user&amp;op=edit">edit account</a> and choose it from the drop down menu.</p>
