I have finally found a supplier of mini-itx things in Canada. In Kingston!

<a href="http://kingstoncomputerplanet.com/">http://kingstoncomputerplanet.com/</a>

They have mini-itx, they have slim cdrw drives (that fit in the Casetronic cases), they have it all at comparable prices to what I paid from <a href="http://big008.com">big008.com</a> in the States.

Wooot!
