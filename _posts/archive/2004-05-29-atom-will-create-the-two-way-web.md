So, this means that the smart money is going to go into the feed space. Because that’s where the action is. Forget AdSense. I need contextual ads built right into my feed. Forget Typepad links, I need the links built right into my feed. Same with comments. And the feed needs to be two way. Atom has that capability I am told. So let me comment right in the feed. That’s a hell of lot better than Trackback.

<p>RSS, comments, and Trackback (plus tools like Technorati) have gone a certain way into giving us a better picture of our neighbours in cyberspace, and the ability to interact more directly.</p>

<p>Atom, being one spec for both reading and writing to weblogs, definitely is a good candidate for the next, full round-trip model of the two way web.</p>
