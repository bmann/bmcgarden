<p>I'm at <a href="http://www.vinocamp.com">VinoCamp</a> for the day, a fun wine event I helped organize. This is the first one we've done, and it all sort of came together at the last minute (I think). We're drinking our first set of wines, and listening to our second presentation. There are tech folks in the audience, posting to Twitter (<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=vinocamp08">VinoCamp 2008</a> or <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=vinocamp">vinocamp</a>).</p>
<p>I think there's a good vibe in the room, the weather outside is beautiful, and the UBC Botanical Gardens space is beautifiul.</p>
<p>I'll do some more updates later, and look for pictures on Flickr to add.</p>

<p>Later being the end of the next day :P I'm just in the midst of uploading my Flickr pics, which will be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/vinocamp">tagged with VinoCamp</a>. Here are some bullet point thoughts still percolating a day and a bit later:</p>
<ul>
<li>10:30am is pretty early in the morning to start drinking wine</li>
<li>a large portion of folks that were "techie" in some way (50%? not sure...)</li>
<li>non-techies not quite sure what to make of laptops, iPhones, and interstitial techie comments</li>
<li>a handful of people Twitter'ing an event gives it a real time feel to the outside world, and a sense of connectedness to the people in the room</li>
<li>scrumpy is a type of strong British cider; apparently, it's <a href="http://www.devon-calling.com/food%20and%20drink/cider.htm">made with raw meat in some recipes</a> (don't ask ...)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/4/82/a37">David Sanders</a> talking (and really, demonstrating) about the shape / type of wine glass and how it affects the flavour made a believer out of me and 95% of the rest of the room...I think an event featuring *just* David and his magical set of <a href="http://riedel.com/">Riedel</a> glasses would be worth the price of admission</li>
<li><a href="http://www.steepcreek.blogspot.com/">Bradley Cooper</a> is <a href="http://twitter.com/bradinator">Bradinator on Twitter</a>, and I was amazed and the amount of back and forth wine chat there is going on around the globe.</li>
<li>14 tastings are rather a lot in one day; some how I didn't quite realize how much wine <a href="http://www.noboundaries.typepad.com/">Lori</a> managed to pull off; no, really, I was thinking maybe 8 wines throughout the whole day</li>
<li>the first time you have an event, you have to "just do it" and hope you can set the tone for follow on events</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/megs_pics/2769620014/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2769620014_15c9d5d4cb_m.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"/></a>
<p>We'll be gathering together resources from the event (blog posts, pointers on the <a href="http://barcamp.org/VinoCamp2008">wiki page</a>, etc. etc.) and putting them in the email. Or at least a link to the wiki to look for all those resources. I'm especially looking forward to feedback from the event. I definitely had fun and would want to do it again, and the tone seemed to be positive ... we'll see what the entire crew had to say.</p>
