<p>I'm glad I waited in posting any sort of "the iPhone with Rogers will suck" commentary, as it seems they have somewhat come to their senses. As usual, <a href="http://johnbiehler.com/2008/07/09/hell-froze-over/">John Biehler was my iPhone news source</a>, and here's the link to the <a href="http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1607093105&view=5804-0&Start=0">Roger's press release</a>.</p>

<p>A new "promotional" data plan is going to be available until August 31st (and I actually believe they'll extend it...), where you can bring your own voice plan, and add a 6GB data plan for only $30 / month. Hmm, maybe over <a href="http://www.ruinediphone.com">50K signatures at ruinediphone.com</a> changed their mind? No, it's not unlimited ... but in talking to <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> -- who is the heaviest mobile app user I know -- he's never gone over 500MB. I think I used a couple of GBs when I was at the Olympics in Torino, and large megapixel camera phones and the fast 3G speeds could certainly eat bandwidth, but 6GB seems fair.</p>

<p>So...am I getting an iPhone? Nope. I don't really like contracts, and I don't like locked phones. I imagine we'll be able to get an unlocked iPhone at some point, where I'll be able to swap out SIM cards when traveling as I do now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, looks like I'll be on CTV Newsnet talking about the other Canadian wireless barons -- Bell and Telus. They are going to start <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080708.wtext0708/BNStory/Technology/home">charging for incoming text messages</a>. Well, this should be a fun ride ... Rogers isn't charging for incoming, it has the iPhone and the latest Nokia phones, and now -- decent data plans. Really, what are Bell and Telus thinking?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like this is not just for iPhone -- you can add this plan to *any* phone, as long as you sign a 3 year contract, and it does apply to Fido as well. See the <a href="http://www.howardchui.com/2008/07/09/rogersfido-data-users-rejoice/">post on howard forums</a> for reference.</p>
