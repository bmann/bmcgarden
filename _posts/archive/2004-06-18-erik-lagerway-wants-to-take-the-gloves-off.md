<blockquote>
Let's take the gloves off. I would like to see Jeff Pulver present a panel in Boston this year at Fall VON. That panel would be comprised of 3 open standards advocates and 3 [if you can find them] pro-proprietary spokesmen. The topic "Open Standards versus Proprietary Technology, Which Will Prevail and Which will Fail!" Each presenter would have 10 minutes to speak their mind. At the end, 2 from each team are chosen to debate the issues for another 15 minutes. During this time the audience will ask the panel questions and each member will have a chance to respond.

<p>It's open standards in this corner vs. the same old proprietary spiel. Hey! Didn't I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1178">suggest that</a>?</p>
