<p>Matt May <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/archive/date/2005/04/quittin-time/">needs hiring</a>. And so I got this crazy idea into my head. An experiment in conversation tracking and tagging, and who knows what else, prompted by Matt's statement &quot;but really, who reads resumes anymore?&quot;.</p>

<p>See the tag at the end of this post? Use &quot;hire matt may&quot;, and it should show up on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/hire+matt+may">this Technorati tags page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I've created a PubSub search for the phrase &quot;hire matt may&quot;, so you should just be able to use that exact phrase anywhere in your post and it will show up on <a href="/aggregator/hire-matt-may">this page</a> (I'm aggregating the PubSub RSS feed -- here's the <a title="RSS feed for PubSub search 'hire matt may'" href="http://rss.pubsub.com/57/ce/32141e8dbb126be9193dc392b9.xml">direct feed link</a>).</p>

<p>So...if you want to, um, hire Matt May, then use the tag or that phrase. Either put up a post suggesting a company where he might like to work, or offer him a job via your weblog, or show support that other people should hire him. Heck, Flickr pictures with a written testimonial (a la <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockergnome/">Pirillo's chest</a>) might even be a good idea.</p>

<p>Who is Matt May? Well, I've been following his weblog for quite some time. I've met him once, very briefly (he may not remember) -- down at the Business Blogging Summit in Seattle. He knows webbie-type stuff, and happens to have a really great podcast as well. I would love to have him as a <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght guy</a> but....well, no but. I don't know if we can afford him right now.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens next...</p>
