<p>I met <a href="http://www.smallthought.com/avi">Avi</a> over 2 years ago when I had just come back to Vancouver, at <a href="http://archive.rolandtanglao.com/2004/02/09.html#a6316">Roland's Geek Dinner</a> (yes, where I met Roland for the first time in person). Avi promptly moved off to Amsterdam so I didn't see much of him for quite some time.</p>  <p>Then he and <a href="http://smallthought.com/andrew/">Andrew</a> were back in Vancouver, getting interested in the Innovation Commons, hanging out at our local &quot;third place&quot;, <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com">Take 5 Cafe</a>, and generally being part of the very interesting Vancouver scene that continues to build.</p>  <p>Avi wowed the computer science nerds at <a href="http://www.oscms-summit.org">the Open Source CMS Summit</a> talking about Smalltalk/Seaside (<a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/roland-tanglao/avi-bryant-smalltalk-seaside-pier-30-seconds-of-oscms-part-2">see the video by Roland</a>), and then thanks to coming out to <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">Northern Voice's MooseCamp</a>, <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/?p=25">landed a spot on Under the Radar</a>. And then <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/?p=26">winning best in show at UTR</a>, showing that made-in-Canada can easily go down to the Valley and kick butt.</p>  <p>And now Avi and Andrew's <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">DabbleDB</a> has made it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/11/dabbledb-online-app-building-for-everyone/">on to TechCrunch</a>:</p>  <blockquote> Every so often I get asked &lsquo;what is the latest hot app&rsquo; and after using DabbleDB I have a new answer to that question. DabbleDB is a platform that allows you to create applications online using a web interface. The sort of applications you would create and then use are what most of us normally hack together in a spreadsheet or using some other database application that is often complex. </blockquote>  <p>Congrats, guys. Still lots of work ahead of you, and the one thing I hope is that you don't get sucked out of Vancouver and down into the Valley...we need these success stories to stick around and continue motivating other local Vancouver teams.</p>
