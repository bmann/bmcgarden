<p>Andy LaCroix just alerted me to the fact that Primus is offering VoIP, in Canada, with Canadian area codes. The service is called "TalkBroadband".</p>

<p>I'm currently walking through the <a href="http://www.primus.ca/en/residential/talkbroadband/index.html">sign-up form</a>, and it all looks very good. The basic service, at $20/month, includes <em>"a phone line, Touch Tone Service, Call Hold, Caller ID Block"</em>.</p>

<p>Read on for more details (yes, I've already signed up).</p>
<!--break-->

<p>The following area codes are available (as of Jan. 2004):</p>

<pre>
416, 647 - Toronto
403 - Calgary
514 - Montreal
613 - Ottawa
604 - Vancouver
780 - Edmonton
905 â€“ Hamilton numbers only. 
</pre>

<p>You can choose a number from any area, it doesn't have to be the one you're actually in. As well, I noticed that as an additional feature, and at a charge of $4 per month, you can purchase a second number. So, you could have one number in Vancouver and one number in Ottawa (which is probably what I'll do, but I'll try it out first).</p>

<p>What about power failures? Well, there is this: <em>For the rare occasions of power failure, Primus provides a free Backup Call Forward service</em></p>

<p>It's your choice to either forward the call to a backup call answer service <strong>or</strong> to another phone number. I'm opting to have it forward to my cell phone number.</p>

<p>Well, we'll see how it goes. I'm all signed up and should be getting my package in the mail!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> was doing some conjecturing about the hardware used for this. The picture on the front page of the <a href="http://www.primus.ca/en/residential/talkbroadband/index.html">Primus site</a> looks like a D-Link. Here's a link to the <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=169" title="D-Link VoIP Gateway">DVG-1120</a>, plus a <a href="http://www.bigbruin.com/html/dlinkdvg1120.htm">review from BigBruin</a>. The review is quite positive, although the way it was setup, being on the phone completely nuked the broadband connection for other traffic. I will have to experiment with how I install, especially as I am using my e-smith server as my router.</p>
