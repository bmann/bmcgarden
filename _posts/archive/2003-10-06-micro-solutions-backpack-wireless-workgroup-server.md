[image:588,left,5,5]I just saw a link to the <a href="http://www.micro-solutions.com/product_info/wws/lit-301xxx.html">Micro Solutions Backpack Wireless Workgroup Server</a>. Basically acts as a standard wireless router plus throws in an 80GB or 120GB hard drive with file sharing. It's configurable without a computer, too.

$699 (80GB version) seems a bit pricey, especially since an entire server from Axentra is listing at $499, but it's the small, fairly rugged form factor that you're paying for. I remember using the Backpack CD drives when I was supporting lots of older machines that didn't have CD drives installed. The drive got jostled around a lot and survived it all.
