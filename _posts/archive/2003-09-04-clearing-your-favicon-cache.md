[image:544,left,10]Likely no one noticed, but I finally replaced the default Drupal favicon. Hmmm...I don't actually remember where I got it -- it was at some free site somewhere.

But, I couldn't get it to show up in Safari. Clearing the cache, restarting the machine, restarting Safari -- none of that worked. So I found <a href="http://www.ircandy.com/openmac/sim/">Safari Icon Manager</a>, which will let you delete individual favicons as well as empty your cache. <a href="http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/tips/favorg.html">FavOrg</a> looks like it does the same thing for IE/Win.
