Ok sports fans, some insider info from the world of Mac - iPod and iMac have been declared EOL, IBM has delivered a reference design for a PowerPC PDA, and there's a rumor going round that Apple and IBM are slated to make an announcement on the same day in a couple months.  Apple rarely makes announcements that are not part of its MacWorld or ADC or Seybold lineup, so this is something that deserves special attention, more so than even a keynote.
