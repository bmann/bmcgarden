Well, not really a complete re-design. Just moving things around a bit, plus turning into a 3-column style. With tables, no less :shocked:

If you go into your <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/usr/edit">user account</a>, you can switch to the "xtemplate" theme to see what I'm working on.

I'm currently losing my mind over some weird stuff where lists aren't displaying properly, but I can't actually tell if it's caching somewhere or what.

<strong>Update:</strong>Yup, it's a caching issue. I've been using my Linux box for routing, since it seems my router has died. It still functions as a switch, but routing functions...borked.

[image:633,left,5,5]So here's a preview of what things are going to look like. Right now, too many dotted lines. I didn't want to have a lots of little boxes feel, don't know if this achieves it. I think I'm going to ditch dotted lines around blockquotes -- the indenting and italicizing are probably already enough. Or perhaps not italicize, just use a different font?
