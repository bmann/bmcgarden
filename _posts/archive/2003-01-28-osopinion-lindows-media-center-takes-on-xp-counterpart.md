osOpinion has an article that <a href="http://www.lindows.com">Lindows</a> is releasing their own software/hardware bundle targetted at being used as a multimedia PC, much like WinXP Media Center Edition:
<blockquote>For its part, the Lindows Media Center combines the functionality of  a standard PC with that of a DVD and CD player, and is compatible with MP3  and VCD formats. Lindows said the device boots in less than 10 seconds. 
<a href="http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/20591.html">Full article on osOpinion</a></blockquote>It's not that interesting of a device, but it is interesting that there is a commercial company now selling a multimedia PC based on Linux. Apparently only being sold online at <a href="http://www.idot.com/">iDotpc.com</a> (which looks to have all sorts of small form factor stuff as well) for $350US. It's called the <a href="http://info.lindows.com/lmc/">Lindows Media Computer</a> on the Lindows site.
