<p>The iTunes <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">support for mobile phones</a> begins today, with Apple's partenership with <a href="http://www.makemedance.com/index.php?section=demo">Motorola's ROKR E1 and the US cell company Cingular</a>.</p>  <p>The big question is of course...can we use it in Canada? Well, the Motorola ROKR is a GSM phone that also supports international networks. Being a GSM phone, it means it also uses SIM cards to activate the phone -- meaning you could use the card from any network provider. Cingular may be distributing the phones as locked, but it probably won't be more than a couple of weeks before a firmware upgrade will unlock it, making it capable of being used on any GSM network. Here in Canada, that's only the Rogers/Fido network.</p> <p style=""><b style="">Update:</b> <a href="http://evans.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/9/7/1204618.html" style="">Mark Evans</a> says the ROKR will be available through Rogers by mid-September, although he doesn't name a source.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/010311.html">Michael Gartenburg covers the iPod Nano</a> -- for us Mac folks, the Windows announcement might get lost in the shuffle: &quot;With the integration with Outlook with iTunes 5.0 and the small size, I can even see folks using this as a personal information manager.&quot;</p>
