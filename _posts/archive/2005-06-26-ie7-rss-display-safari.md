<p>I did find it strange how similar the IE7 display of feeds was to Safari. And by similar I mean identical.</p>

They couldn&rsquo;t even innovate on the details of the layout. Compare the blurry photo-of-slide of <a href="http://bink.nu/photos/news_article_images/picture9241.aspx">Microsoft&rsquo;s feed display</a> with a similar blurry photo of <a href="http://nikkeibp.jp/jp/report/shared/mti20040628-wwdc07.jpg">Safari RSS</a> from <em>last year&rsquo;s</em> Apple developer conference. (Since that photo we added a search field at the top, making the resemblance even more spooky.) The main difference in the appearance is that MS had to bathe it in that unique gray boxy dorkiness of theirs.
