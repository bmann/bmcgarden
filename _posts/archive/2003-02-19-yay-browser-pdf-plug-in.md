In OS X, an annoying thing when looking at PDFs in a browser is that they get downloaded/open an external PDF viewer (either Acrobat, or by default the generic Preview app -- which is much faster than Acrobat, but is still an external app).

<strong>But</strong>....I came across a <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/plugin/">PDF Browser Plug-in</a>. That page even has a funky <em>embedded</em> pdf that you will be able to view once you install the plug-in and restart your browser. And yes, it works with Safari.
