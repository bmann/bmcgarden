[The enterprise search] market is still nascent, and there are buckets of money there (just ask Microsoft or FAST.) Mark my words, boring as it might seem, corporate search will be a big deal. And...there will be interesting implications w/r/t transparency and the like once all those corporate documents are discovered by the internal crawler.<cite><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000617.php">John Battelle's Searchblog: Enterprise Search (Yaawwwwnnn)</a></cite>

<p>Having worked at large <a href="http://www.nortelnetworks.com">corporations</a>, I can tell you that more attention needs to be paid to the enterprise search market. Competitive intelligence, knowledge management, internal weblogs -- all these things need a tie-in to search as well. Heck, document management is something that many companies are still grappling with.</p>

<p>Weblogs, email, and P2P concepts are three things that will intersect in this space. Oh, and I guess I'll throw profiles in there as well: internal subject matter experts centralizing information but being connected throughout the organization with other communities of practice.</p>

<p>Since lots of corporate information is hidden in various other systems -- databases, groupware, etc. -- these systems need to be scanning the "deep web". But I think the missing piece is to take that information and not only return a link to it (if possible) but enable it to be published elsewhere and categorized, like the blogging model.</p>
