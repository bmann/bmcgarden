Matthew Lin came by and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1284">posted his request to fill out his blog survey</a>.

I first saw this over at <a href="http://www.businessblogconsulting.com/2004/07/survey_on_use_o.html">Rick E. Bruner's Business Blog Consulting</a>, and I did fill out the survey. Maybe Matthew saw my URL and decided to check it out.

So, if you read this site and have a business blog, go <a href="
http://business.unbsj.ca/bblog/">fill out the survey</a>.
