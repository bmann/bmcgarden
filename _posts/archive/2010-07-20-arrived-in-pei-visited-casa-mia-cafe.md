<p>I'm going to try and keep a few short notes in my asides section on this trip to PEI.</p>
<p>This was my first "red eye" traveling in North America. That is, I intentionally chose an overnight flight as opposed to Europe, where you're usually losing a day in some way because of the time change.</p>
<p>PEI is Atlantic time (4 hours time difference from Pacific), so leaving at 11:30pm from Vancouver on Monday night meant that I got here around 10:30am on Tuesday morning after a transfer in Montreal.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how I feel about the overnight flight -- spending a whole day flying (once you add in the 4 hours you lose) isn't great, so I decided to use that "wasted" time overnight, making sure that I still had a day to get rested before I started my events here.</p>
<p>In any case, I made it safe and sound if a little groggy and emerged into the sunlight on the tarmac of the Charlottetown airport. It's a small airport where you walk off the plane and directly into the arrivals / exit. I got set up with a rental car and made the short drive to town.</p>
<p>My hosts are putting me up at the Great George Hotel -- some times also called the Inns on Great George (plural) because it's a number of separate buildings with different kinds of apartments and rooms. The person at the front desk ("Frankie", which somehow smacks of PEI) led me 2 blocks from the lobby to where I would be staying. I've got a kitchen, so I might see about getting fresh ingredients and putting a meal together while I'm here.</p>
<p>Aside from having a long nap and doing some work on my presentations, I did make it to <a href="http://casamiacafe.ca/">Casa Mia Cafe</a>, the <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/2882/social-media/bluetooth-lastfm-making-caf%C3%A9-react-its-customers-ruk-cc-rtanglao-termie">Bluetooth scanning cafe of legend</a>. It had an entry on Yelp, but no reviews, so I <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/casa-mia-cafe-charlottetown">wrote one</a> about my lunch + coffee. <a href="http://twitter.com/ruk/status/19010864988">Peter Rukavina confirmed that I was scanned by the system</a> while I was there, so I'm glad to have checked that off my list. Sadly, no message pushed to my phone or other acknowledgment.</p>
