We&#39;d love to have your thoughts and submissions -- the last minute rush to enter submissions has led to a fabulous selection that is going to be hard to choose from.</p>  <p>The organizers are meeting next week to fight tooth and nail for their favourite entries. In the mean time, <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/register">registration is open</a>, so you can go ahead and get your tickets now. We&#39;ve got slightly more room than in past years, but we&#39;ve sold out every year so far...</p>  <p>And what about Boris&#39; traditional Northern Voice crazy plans? Well, we&#39;re still debating, but I might get to put together a geocaching / GPS adventure. We&#39;ll start it as one of the last sessions of Moose Camp, and end the day wandering the UBC campus with GPS in hand. Ideally, we&#39;ll have some photographers along to document the process, and we&#39;ll be able to combine GPS timelogs with photos and see it all on a map.</p>  <p>Do you know someone that knows all about geocaching? I&#39;d like to talk to them...</p> <!--break-->
