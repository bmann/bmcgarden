<p><a href="/blog/bmann/twitter-is-jabber#comment-136131">Les&#39; comment</a> was too good to languish in the comments. Content management systems and blogs are now clearly at the &quot;easy to self host level&quot;. How long will it take to be able to easily do the same thing with a Jabber server?</p><p>In the light of ongoing PHP wrangling, PHP is also likely not the best language to be writing that server in. </p><blockquote><p>What I think would be a hot &quot;Twitter killer&quot; (successor?) would be something self-hosted like WordPress or Drupal. I&#39;ve been idly thinking about this since I first saw the site, so my ears perk up when I see discussion like this :)</p><p>I think XMPP would be excellent for communication for node-to-node and user-to-node. The user-to-user case works for a private IM back channel, but even there it might help to have a web-based Jabber client and maybe a custom XMPP server with an archival plugin tapping in.</p><p>Another thing I&#39;ve been wondering is what limitations XMPP might introduce in deployment cost in a cheap PHP hosting world where WordPress, etal thrive? How hard is it to run your own XMPP server, or is it really necessary? (I&#39;m spoiled because I&#39;ve either always had root on my own dedicated / virtual server, or shared a server that had a Jabber server running.)</p><p>Along with XMPP, though, I think a few other federation options might be handy. Optionally CC&#39;ing to an account on Twitter / Jaiku / iStalker / etc itself via the API to keep looped into an existing community - dirty, but handy. Also, polling RSS / Atom / JSON feeds to &quot;pull&quot; updates for a friend subscribed on the self-hosted node who&#39;s not in the XMPP loop.</p><p>In any case, I think XMPP is an excellent foundation for a network of self-hosted Twitter-esque nodes. I&#39;m just wondering what else needs to be layered on and how.</p></blockquote><p>Â Now go over and <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/">subscribe to the rest of Les&#39; stuff -- you probably know him as decafbad</a>.</p> <!--break-->
