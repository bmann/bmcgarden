<p>There seem to be lots of cranky people about the Web 2.0 meme. I think that used as hype, it's not that useful. As a general label for a lot of things that are happening with technological, social, and business changes, I find it useful. After all, it seems to be one of those things that you can recognize when you see it.</p>  <p>Brent Holliday, a partner in Vancouver-based <a href="http://www.greenstonevc.com/">Greenstone Venture Partners</a>, recently posted an <a href="http://www.bctechnology.com/statics/bh-oct0705.html">anti-hype rant on the BC's T-Net site</a>. He makes some really good points, but comes across a little bitter about some of the useful aspects of Web 2.0. I'm hoping to help explain some of those useful aspects, in plain natural language at the October 25th <a href="http://www.vef.org">Vancouver Enterprise Forum</a> event. <a href="http://blame.ca">Dick Hardt</a> is running the show, and there are some really great local speakers lined up, including:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland Tanglao</a> giving his blogging, etc. talk</li> <li><a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/">Andre Charland</a>, who has been doing AJAX before it was called that</li> <li><a href="http://fergusson.net/">Michael Fergusson</a> on user generated content </li><li><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul Kedrosky</a>, giving a good business perspective on the whole industry and how it all ties together, and who is so well known outside Vancouver that I tend to forget he's a local</li> </ul>  <p>Note to Brent: when BC T-Net updates their CMS 1.0, you can get them to fix the mis-spelling of your name at the top of your <a href="http://www.bctechnology.com/statics/bh-bio.html">bio page</a>. :P</p>
