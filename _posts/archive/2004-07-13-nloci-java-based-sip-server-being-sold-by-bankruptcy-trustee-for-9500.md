	Looks like the company <a href="http://www.nloci.com/">nLoci</a> is the one that developed the code, and then ran out of capital. Now the trustee is selling the assets. Of course, with companies like <a href="http://www.pingtel.com/a_opensource.jsp">Pingtel going open source</a>, it may be that even $9,500 is too high of a price.</p>
