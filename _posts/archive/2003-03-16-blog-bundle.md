<p>
	I&#39;ve said it once, and I&#39;m going to say it again: <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> is fantastic.</p>
<p>
	May I direct your attention to the right, to the box entitled &quot;Interesting Blogs&quot;: that is a bundle of RSS feeds, grouped by the term &quot;blog&quot;.</p>
<p>
	Right now, the items are a little scrambled, because I manually updated them, and updated Dave&#39;s SmithDM3 blog last, so all his items appear first. As the RSS feeds get refreshed, the items will be from all over the place. Visit the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=import&amp;op=bundles">bundles section</a> of newsfeeds to see the ones I&#39;ve defined.</p>
<p>
	Again, if anyone has feeds to suggest, just leave a comment on this item.</p>
