<p>Did anyone ever doubt that the "picture" feature would get added to Skype? I mean, there were even placeholder spots since day one. This announcement does keep the hype machine rolling, however. Not that I've been consistently pointing out that many of Skype's actions are geared towards maintaining hype, oh no, I would never do thatâ€¦</p>
