<p[>It's not up on <a href="http://www.primustel.ca/en/about/press/index.htm">Primus' press release page</a>, but this comes from <a href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2004/30/c9682.html">Canada NewsWire</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
PRIMUS Telecommunications Canada Inc. (PRIMUS Canada) is partnering with Best Buy and Future Shop to make TalkBroadband(TM), Canada's leading Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone service, available at retail outlets across the country.
</blockquote>

<p>Now what Future Shop/Best Buy should do is have a live version of TalkBroadband set up in their stores, but set it so that you can only call other TalkBroadband users, including those in other stores.</p>

<p>What the heck: let them call anyone in North America -- it's only $40 a month, after all, and would pretty much drive home the advantages pretty clearly.</p>
