I just went ahead and did it. It was actually fairly painless. I have to re-do my theme, but everything should be working.

Please post if you see something that's hideously broken.

The Drupal release of <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/2407">4.20</a> has all the details of what has changed. It should be much easier to do a full CSS theme, plus -- friendly URLs!
<!--break-->
Should increase the Googlejuice. I have to add some lines to the .htaccess file to get <a href="/node/view/58/">my most popular item</a> working. Or rather, it's old url.

I guess the other steps will include looking what sort of modules have been updated, and perhaps install some new ones -- like smilies :p
