<p>A few highlights from posts elsewhere. Yes, I have to figure out a combined feed strategy.</p>

<p>I'm attending the <a href="http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008">CCI2008 conference</a> here in Vancouver, and did a first post about it <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/blogs-and-pods/boris-mann/content-convergence-integration-conference-2008-day-1-content">on the Raincity Studios blog</a>. I'm speaking on Friday, covering <a href="http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008/sessions/6567/details">data silos, content sharing, and open source</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like I'll be on <a href="http://www.bnn.ca">BNN</a> tonight, with my first TV appearance representing Bootup Labs. See <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2008/03/12/press-appearance-bnn-with-howard-green-645pm-est-technology-makes-it-harder-to-cover-your-tracks/">the BUL blog for the details</a>, 6:45PM EST on cable.</p>
