<p>As Richard puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
In an ideal world, though, no weblog would have comments enabled, but everybody would have their own weblog. You remember that old clich√©, the freedom of the press goes only to those who own one. Well, there is remarkably little stopping you from owning one these days.

<p>The rest of Richard's post is actually about some problems with TypeKey, plus the de-centralized nature of weblog comments. I find that short comments that I make on other sites are generally forgotten (by me, in any case). If I have something longer to say (and this sometimes is only realized as I start typing) I'll make a post about it and point at the entry.</p>

<p>Also -- <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> is fast becoming a way that people track mentions. <a href="http://idly.org/2004/04/14/a_world_without_typekey">Adam Gessaman</a> then does an excellent job of showing that you can "Technorati Bomb" just like you can game other systems.</p>
