<p>So the current meme in blogland is "RSS-Data". Basically, cramming a bunch of other stuff into RSS feeds so that it can be usefully used/consumed/displayed on the receiving end: everything from weather information to event/calendar information.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea. Except, as I watched all these ideas roll past, that it didn't sound like such a great idea. And then I found that <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/001278.html">LaughingMeme pretty much agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremey Allaire has proposed RSS-Data, an attempt to wedge XML-RPC serialization into RSS, an idea which is so phenomenally bad, and wrong headed, I'm momentarily speechless. (At least of anything I would say in public)</p>

<p>The joy, however, of being behind the curve is someone else has already said it for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go read the full article for pointers to lots of other people that aren't that thrilled by RSS-Data. It can be basically summarized by saying "We've already got this, it's called RDF, and it works".</p>
