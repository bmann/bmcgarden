<p>The wonderfully useful <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/" title="Schubert it - PDF Browser Plugin">PDF Browser plugin</a> has been updated. Most importantly the update improves smooth scrolling. Great work.

There also seems to be a <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginword/" title="Word plugin">plugin for Word documents</a> now. It claims to be text-only and may come handy if you can't avoid them.

<p>It looks like the PDF Plugin is now "for pay" if you want to use it in a commercial context. Will have to give the Word plug-in a whirl, although I don't see too many raw .doc files on the Internet anymore.</p>
