<p>So, I was completely wrong about <a href="/blog/bmann/video-ipod-or-airport-express-video">Airport Express Video</a> (but wouldn't be surprised to see it at some time in the future).</p>  <p>Thanks to the UK magazine <a href="http://www.stuffmag.co.uk/hotstuffarticle.asp?de_id=594">Stuff</a>, I was getting real time updates about the big Apple event today. The three announcements were:</p>  <ul> <li>new iMacs, with built in iSight and Front Row app including remote: a 10ft UI for Macs; yes, I do want to get this for my home machine</li> <li>The video iPod: 30GB for $299, $60GB $399, comes with a video out port to connect directly to your TV; score one for my long-ago predictions</li> <li>iTunes 6, which includes for-pay video downloads: today this is only music videos and some short Pixar ones for $1.99; I expect licensing to be a real PITA for Apple, but I also expect them to announce other licensed video content over time. Would I pay $1.99 per TV show? Well, since I don't have cable, yes I would -- that would be 2 hours per week of only the shows *I* want to watch. And this makes easy, legal</li> </ul>  <p>Am I going to get a video iPod? Well, I'll be consuming video on my computer at home, with its big LCD TV screen. And, as Graham said, I actually don't find mobile video on the iPod compelling. Now, if they did a deal with Sony to have it on the PSP...</p><p>But video downloads are a *big deal*. There will be lots more about this over the coming days, I'm sure.&nbsp;</p>
