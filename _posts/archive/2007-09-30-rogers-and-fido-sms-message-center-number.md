title: Rogers and Fido SMS Message Center Number
---
<p>For future reference, I found a <a href="http://kb.palm.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/WEBCGI.EXE?New,kb=PalmSupportKB,CASE=obj(28591),ts=Palm_External2001">Palm article that mentions the Rogers SMS message center number</a>. The number is +17057969300 for Rogers, and +15149931123 for Fido. You'll need to change this in <kbd>Messaging > Settings > Text Message > Message centres</kbd> (on Series 60 phones), as well as set the Message centre in use. A reboot is required, and any messages in the Outbox won't work...they'll still have the old message center number in it.</p>
