<p><a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a> hosted a <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/221709/">meetup</a> for Joyent customers and friends tonight at Chill Winston. I'll place myself in the "friend" column, and really, if you host a get together in the lounge that is on the ground floor of my office building, you know I'll be showing up :P</p>

<p>I wrote up some more thoughts on <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/joyent-meetup-and-thoughts-on-virtualization">virtualization and my discussion with Mark Mayo over on my Bryght blog</a> (or included here directly via transclusion).</p>

<p>P.S.: I almost forgot to congratulate you on the <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?pid=136511">naming system for servers that uses Vancouver street names</a>. Bryght just uses Canadian mountie names :P</p>
