<p>We&#39;re just under 2 weeks away from the second <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">DemoCampVancouver</a> event on July 5th. There is an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=2406253086">event on Facebook</a>, and you may also <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver02">list yourself on the wiki</a>, especially if you want to start socializing an idea you want to demo. The guys from <a href="http://www.eqo.com">EQO</a> would like to demo their new mobile client – add yourself to the list!<br /> </p><p>Remember we are changing the format slightly, based on feedback. Everyone that comes with a demo idea will be given a 30 second pitch time at the beginning, then we&#39;ll have all the attendees vote, and the top four demo ideas will then each get 6 minutes.</p><p>I&#39;m going to invite a bunch of extra people to stack the deck for my pick: a talk on what cohousing is, along with details of the <a href="http://www.windsong.bc.ca/">Windsong cohousing community in Langley</a>. </p><p>We&#39;re looking into a liquor license for the evening, if only to have the comfort of a cold beer in hand while we listen to presenters. There are no sponsors per-se, but the license may incur some costs. If you&#39;re interested in helping out with this, please get in touch.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="http://www.ventureswest.com/Team/Profiles/David_Mcintyre.asp">David Mcintyre of Ventures West</a> pinged me to say that he can bring a 2ft gong to the event. Yes, a gong. Unfortunately, Dane from WorkSpace already called dibs on being &quot;gong boy&quot;. Perhaps we&#39;ll raffle off this unique opportunity next time :P Thanks David and Ventures West...I&#39;m looking forward to the event even more now that I know it will be gong-enabled.</p><p>We also talked a bit about PowerPoint games or other such antics. This isn&#39;t fully baked yet, please add suggestions to the wiki on how we should run this, and let us know if you want to participate in that portion. </p><p>DemoCampVancouver coming up too quickly and your idea isn&#39;t fully backed? <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007">BarCampVancouver 2007 happens August 17th and 18th</a>...although we&#39;re at capacity! Some ideas on making more space may be required... </p>
