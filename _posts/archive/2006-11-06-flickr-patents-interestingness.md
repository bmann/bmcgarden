<p>Via IM from <a href="http://www.walkah.net">James</a> and <a href="http://bopuc.levendis.com/weblog/archives/-2006/11/06/when_the_money_comes_knocking_egotism_answers.php">posting from bopuc</a>, it seems that <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220060242139%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20060242139&amp;RS=DN/20060242139">Flickr is patenting &quot;interestingness&quot;</a>.</p><p>What?!</p><p>Are you kidding me?!</p><p>How about we do the same thing...only call it &quot;intriguingness&quot;. Perhaps &quot;disgustedness&quot; would be a better term.</p><p>Reading through the patent, it seems very specific to interestingness and Flickr&#39;s implementation. So, I would kind of figure...why bother patenting? I guess this is the lawyers at Yahoo getting hinky.<br /> </p>
