<p>I should probably have more to say about the <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/002520.html">blog meetup</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> got everybody's URL down at the meetup, so I'll get those from him on Monday, or wait for him to post them. Update: <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=304">Kris' post</a> which has everybody linked.</p>

<p>I did see <a href="http://ianking.ca/article/673/met-up">Ian King's post</a>. It was great to meet him -- I've been reading him for a while, and I got lots of scoops on the local paper media landscape from him.</p>

<p>Darren got some feedback that some people felt that the meetups were getting too &quot;business&quot; focused. There is a fair bit of truth to this: I am a bad <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">personal blogger</a>, and I am caught up in too many business-related blogging activities to, well, relax and keep it personal. I keep jumping ahead to technology solutions or business connections.</p>

<p>Darren wanted me to start running a Business Blogger Meetup. I'm involved in too many things already to run with this, but I would certainly attend on occasion. Actually, I continue to hate the term &quot;blog&quot; -- I would suggest NOT labelling it &quot;business blogger&quot;: it's too short sighted and too limiting. Maybe we'll call it a &quot;Web 2.0 Meetup&quot; -- inclusive of technology and business? I guess that means I'm nominating <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> or <a href="http://www.hopstudios.com">Suzie and Travis</a> to run it. Or <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com">Tris</a>, but that means he has to fly over to Vancouver every month.</p>

<p>And remember, if I'm going to get labelled as the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1451">Blog Therapist</a> as well as having <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/002515.html">my name's tag on Flickr being associated with beer</a>, we have to keep up the tradition of calling <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com" title="Darren Barefoot is the Vancouver Blogfather">Darren Barefoot the Blogfather</a>.</p>
