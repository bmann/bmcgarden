I've started a <a href="http://links.bmannconsulting.com" title="Boris Mann's Link Blog">link blog</a>. Basically, bookmarks aren't cutting it anymore, and I needed a way to categorize differently, and I didn't want to pollute the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/weblink">weblink directory</a> here, and finally most importantly WordPress has a "bookmarklet" that lets me blog directly without having to create any new posts or anything.

The content also appears here, both <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/feed/93">imported as a feed</a>, and it will be mixed in with the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/bundle/11">Interesting Blogs</a> links at right.

I still have to hack the RSS feed so that it sticks in the main link as the title link. I think. I always hated that about some Radio feeds, since I couldn't go to the comment on the article.
