<p>So, I&#39;m back from a short <a href="http://www.listsofbests.com/list/8007">roadtrip vacation</a> with <a href="http://www.adventureswithkate.com">Kate</a>, and I&#39;m just about to go to the airport to fly to Stuttgart. Only it turns out I have a 9hr layover in Heathrow tomorrow, starting 11am London time. Any tips on what do with roughly 6 hours of free time?</p><p>Also: don&#39;t forget about the <a href="/blog/bmann/iosvan-identity-open-space-in-vancouver-in-july">Identity Open Space event here in Vancouver</a> (check the <a href="http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSVan">wiki</a> for more info), happening next week on July 20th and 21st. I am unfortunately missing it, but <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/colin">Colin Brumelle</a> is attending on my behalf.&nbsp;</p>
