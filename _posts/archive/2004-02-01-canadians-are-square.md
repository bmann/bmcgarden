<p>Did you know that Robertson screws/screwdrivers are Canadian?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard for a Canadian to imagine that there are people in the world still struggling with slot-headed or Phillips screws. Robertson, a Canadian inventor, developed the square-head screw and driver. And it’s about the only screw we use, when given the choice. I’ve driven, or tried to, screws of every stripe over the past 40 years, and there is simply no contest: Robertson rules.</p>
