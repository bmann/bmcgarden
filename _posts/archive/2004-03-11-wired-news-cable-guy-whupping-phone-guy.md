<p>Just like cable broadband is slowly overtaking DSL broadband, it seems like they're taking a major chunk of telephony revenues as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comcast Communications and Cox Communications have quietly climbed to the top rungs of telephone providers, helping the cable industry capture about $900 million in telephone revenue in the United States in 2003, or about 2.5 million residential customers, according to MRG, a digital media research firm. It projects cable operators could capture $8.1 billion in U.S. revenue, or 22 million subscribers, by 2007 -- or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. residential telephone market.</p>

<p>Note: this isn't VoIP -- yet. These numbers are for <em>"phones hooked up to cable lines"</em>. I'm now starting to think that equal access requirements really should apply to cable operators as well.</p>
