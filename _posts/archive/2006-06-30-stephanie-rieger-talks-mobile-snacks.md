<p>Stephanie Rieger has a <a href="http://stephanierieger.com/content/casual-mobile-snacks-for-everyone/">great post on casual mobile gaming</a>:</p>  <blockquote> We have a unique opportunity with mobile devices in that they can be insanely personal and private while being incredibly social and contextual (presence, location etc.) They can offer small moments of quiet play or learning&mdash;no peers, no pressure&mdash;or small moments of highly networked interaction and competition. Not to mention hybrids of the two. </blockquote>  <p>I&#39;m doing more thinking about mobile as I talk to younger people in North America (like <a href="http://ptorgie.wordpress.com">Petrina</a>) and also spend more time in Europe, where mobile is so much more pervasive.</p>  <p>In case you were wondering, <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.innovationcommons.ca">innovation</a> is alive and well in Vancouver. Now go and <a href="http://mobili.st/?p=17">vote for Stephanie&#39;s post for Carnival of the Mobilists</a>.</p>
