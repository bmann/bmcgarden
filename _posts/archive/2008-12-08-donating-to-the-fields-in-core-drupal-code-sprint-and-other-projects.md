<p>Dries recently wrote about <a href="http://buytaert.net/fields-in-drupal-core-code-sprint">funding a code sprint for Fields in core</a>. <a href="http://acquia.com">Acquia</a> is committed to funding various bits and pieces and supporting it directly. I know what that's like -- <a href="http://bryght.com">Bryght</a> and some of our clients funded many early Drupal improvements and gatherings directly.</p>

<p><embed allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="color_scheme=blue&amp;event_desc=Help%20us%20raise%20money%20to%20fund%20the%20Fields%20in%20Drupal%20core%20code%20sprint%2E&amp;event_title=Fields%20in%20core%20sprint" height="250" src="http://widget.chipin.com/widget/id/95d5a4ba2b9ac0f4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="250" wmode="transparent"></p>

<p>So why should you support this particular code sprint? Well, for one, it means we can ideally have one of the key innovations of CCK / Views directly in the core of Drupal, making it a more robust / scalable / flexible system. Me? I just want to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/141419">kill the profile module</a> and move a few other alternate field-light systems to a native field solution (e.g. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">webform</a>). Don't have money to donate? That's OK, head on over to the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/fields-core">Fields in Core group</a> and participate with golden code. Or golden UI mockups. Or golden patch testing. You get the picture...</p>

<p>I, personally, have a history of trying to round up funding for various improvements. Since I can only code well enough to convince other people it should be done better, I try and spend my energies describing possible solutions or rallying money/resources behind such ideas.</p>

<p>I actively encourage companies and individual contributors to put up donate buttons. I've recently been in need of large / multiple file uploads, so I approached the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/swfupload">SWFUpload</a> maintainers, helped clean up the issue queue, and set up a big chipin right on the project page. That money will go directly to developers working on making this solution better.</p>

<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/privatemsg">Privatemsg</a> is another module that has a donate button, but they are actually few and far between. I've made some <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/17304#comment-59376">comments on commercial interests on Drupal.org itself</a>, but at the same time, I absolutely want to help support a commercial ecosystem. One way of doing that is for module maintainers to put donate / contact me buttons directly on their module pages. Why, for instance, doesn't <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Earl put a donate button on the Views project page</a>?</p>

<p>The danger, of course, is tying or expecting compensation. You share (primarily) for "community ROI" -- every piece of code, comment, design, support request that you interact with in a larger community is something that you are giving ... and the return on your invested time WILL come back to you many fold in a number of different ways. Increased exposure, increased business, better code, more connections. Direct participation in the community is worth MORE than money.</p>

<p>But look at the code you use and the people behind it. If you feel you can't commit time or your own resources, money is a perfectly acceptable substitute. Any of the items I've mentioned here are things I consider worth funding. Pick one of them, or think about a donation directly to the maintainer of some module that you use regularly.</p>
