<p>Andy Abramson's test of the AT&T CallVantage service is working out well. He figures that the quality and reliability of the service will serve as a benchmark:</p>

<blockquote>
Candidly, I'm not surprised the service is this good. AT&T has too much to lose in putting out an inferior product. By putting out a product that is at basic mode already better than the competition which went first, AT&T has really fired a shot that will be heard around the telephony world.<cite><a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/2004/04/my_callvantage_.html">VoIP Watch (Andy Abramson): My CallVantage Service Is Working</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>My gut instinct is that features and cost will be what consumers <em>actually</em> care about, as long as certain service and quality levels are met.</p>
