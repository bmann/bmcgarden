<p>With the Apple event last week, I was a bit surprised at the ringtone announcement. At first glance, it seemed like a money grab. What, 99¢ for songs you already have? I don't get it.</p>

<p>Today I came upon the concept that music publishers consider a ringtone a "performance" of the song that must be licensed separately, hence there are actual costs to Apple if it wants to say "this is a ringtone".</p>

<p>For more background, read an <A href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061024-8063.html>"Ars Technica article from last year</a>. The <a href="http://www.harryfox.com/public/infoFAQRingtones.jsp">FAQ at Harry Fox Agency</a> (the largest issuer of music licenses in the US) is interesting to read through as well.</p>

<p>Ringtones for 99¢? Apparently, we should be glad to be paying so little. Or being allowed to use them at all? In any case, it seems to be fairly simple to <a href="http://joemaller.com/2007/09/08/make-custom-iphone-ringtones-work-with-itunes-741/">use some file renaming to make ringtones out of existing songs</a>.</p>
