<p><a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/">Jason Santa Maria wrote a long post called A Real Web Design Application</a>, where he talks about searching for a tool that has the creativity of Photoshop with more of a native understanding of the web. It's a good read, and the comments are over 250 and counting.</p>
<p>I remember talking about how Dreamweaver is dead as part of my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/archive/web-directions-north-2008-3-stages-of-dynamic-systems-wrap-up/">3 Stages of Dynamic Systems talk at Web Directions North 2008</a>. And yet, just the other day I met with someone that was doing a content-based startup and had built hundreds of pages with Dreamweaver templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, I tend to still reach for&nbsp;<a href="">OmniGraffle</a>&nbsp;for prototyping, site maps, and so on. On the other end of things, I'm still using a basic text editor for coding (<a href="">Smultron</a>). I love the team at&nbsp;<a href="">Balsamiq</a>, but I just haven't been able to get over my distaste for AIR apps. I don't use Photoshop, because I'm design-disabled :P</p>
<p>In any case, I found two interesting tools in the comment thread that might at the very least be Dreamweaver killers.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>I'm still interested in a "tool" that will make it easy for all those people using static-HTML-making desktop apps to switch to working with web apps like WordPress, Drupal, etc. (static HTML.... why? why??! <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=khaaaaan">KhAAAAAAANNNNN!</a>)</p>
<p>The first is <a href="http://www.theescapers.com/flux/">Flux</a>. The front page does, indeed, have a quote calling it a Dreamweaver killer. I was immediately intrigued by the fact that it has "plugins". These are standard JavaScript libraries and effects bundled in a special packaging format so they can be handled by the WYSIWYG editor / inspector. Waitâ€¦ a tool thingie that uses the same libraries we use all the time when hand coding? Great!</p>

<p>I poked around the Flux forums a bit and didn't find anything about CMS support other than <a href="http://www.theescapers.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1386">a thread where everyone asks them to support their favourite CMS</a>. A link found there talks about some of the <a href="http://foundationphp.com/blog/2010/04/12/dreamweaver-cs5-is-good-news-for-php-devs/">code abilities in Dreamweaver CS5 over at foundationphp.com</a>.</p>
<p>The second tool is <a href="http://www.antetype.com">Antetype</a>. This is definitely much more in the direction of a prototype builder, and not exclusively targeted at only web design. It's not publicly available yet, but the widget libraries and web viewer export make it very intriguing. More of a potential OmniGraffle replacement than anything to do with HTML.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.antetype.com"><img alt="" class="imagecache-fullpost lightbox" src="/sites/bmannconsulting.com/files/imagecache/fullpost/postimages/Screen shot 2010-08-01 at 8.13.36 PM.png" title=""></a></p>
<p>So, will a code editor grow design abilities or will a design tool grow code abilities? I see what Jason is looking for as a design-centric tool that can manipulate chunks of code as objects tied to design elements, with of course CSS abilities for applying styling to text across projects (aka cascading, of course).</p>
