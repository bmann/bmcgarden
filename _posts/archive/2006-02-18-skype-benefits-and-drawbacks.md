<p>Some quick notes for an upcoming interview.</p>  <p>Benefits</p> <ul> <li>free voice calls between Skype users</li> <li>easy multi-person conferencing (up to 50, depending on bandwidth)</li> <li>multi-platform -- works on Windows, Mac, and Linux</li> <li>first IM client for many users who use voice feature first</li> <li>easy file sharing</li> <li>can have &quot;real&quot; phone numbers in many locations</li> <li>can also use video (various solutions, Windows only for now)</li> <li>Skype on your phone -- Microsoft PocketPC has a Skype client, <a href="http://www.eqo.com">EQO</a> is new and works on Symbian Series 60 and other Java capable phones (client currently requires Windows on desktop)</li> </ul>  <p>Disclaimer: EQO is a local Vancouver company that I've met with, and my company <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> powers their online community forums. They're also the only mobile app other than <a href="http://www.shozu.com">ShoZu</a> that made my jaw drop (well, until I found out about the desktop client requirement...boo!).</p>  <p>Drawbacks</p> <ul> <li>have to have Skype to communicate (or pay for SkypeOut)</li> <li>built on a closed network, closed protocols (as opposed to open standards like <a href="http://www.sipforum.org/">SIP</a> or <a title="Jabber / XMPP voice and video spec promoted by Google and others" href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0166.html">JINGLE</a>)</li> <li>computers on open networks might be used as a SuperNode, consuming lots of bandwidth</li> <li>Skype (now bought by <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>) is the only provider of the service</li> </ul>  <p>Other forward looking options include click-to-buy or click-to-access solutions -- use your Skype ID and the client to pay for online goods and services, including restricted access to online content -- enter your Skype ID into a web form, get messaged with a special code, complete a transaction, receive an access code -- voila! instant online access. Note: this is of course possible with any IM service or even SMS, and Jabber is doing this today. In many ways, Skype is JAIS -- Just Another Identity Store -- that happens to have VoIP/IM/etc. built on top of it as an application.</p><p><a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Project Gizmo</a> is likely the best open competitor to Skype, although <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">GoogleTalk</a> needs watching, especially if they federate/interoperate with both iChat and AOL instant messenger. Yes, yet more identity stores....once username AT domain.com &quot;just works&quot;, we will be free to pick whatever client app we like.<br /> </p>
