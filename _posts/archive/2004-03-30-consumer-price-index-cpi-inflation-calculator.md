<blockquote>
This is an inflation calculator for adjusting costs from one year to another using the  Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation index.  This inflation calculator is based on the average inflation index during the calendar year. This inflation calculator will compute inflation rates between 1913 and 2003. The  CPI represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by  urban households. User fees (such as water and sewer service) and sales and excise taxes  paid by the consumer are also included. Income taxes and investment items (like stocks,  bonds, and life insurance) are not included
