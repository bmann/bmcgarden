<p>Tomorrow is the Macworld 2009 keynote, this time by Phil Schiller instead of Jobs. Regardless, it's that time of year again -- Apple rumour time! Mac Rumors is still my favourite site for this sort of thing -- here is their <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/01/04/macworld-san-francisco-2009-rumor-roundup/">2009 rumor roundup</a>. They are on twitter now, so as well as the MacRumorsLive site, you can also follow them @macrumors.</p>
<p>The rumors seem pretty believable. I'd like to think something more exciting is planned for the MacBook Pro 17&quot; than just a better battery. Maybe touchscreen instead of a keyboard? That's what I&nbsp;was thinking last time ... no keyboard, no trackpad, an entire touchscreen / tablet interface on the &quot;bottom half&quot;. Think what this would do for audio mixers, Photoshop tools, etc. etc. I call this crazy wild idea the &quot;Macbook DS&quot;&nbsp;(partial props to <a href="http://acko.net">UnConed</a> on that one). (you know, kind of like <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/12-macbook-pro-with-touchscreen-keyboard">I predicted 2 years ago </a>:P)</p>
<p>I've been &quot;predicting&quot; a <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/mac-tablet-media-mac-itunes-movies-predictions">Mac Tablet</a> for 4 years now. Today, it would be more like a super iPhone or iPod Touch, with a 7&quot; screen. Hmm...the iMac Touch? I'd love to see this one, but it's probably a little early for this -- <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/12/30/large-screen-ipod-touch-device-in-fall-of-2009/">Macrumors thinks we might see it this fall</a>. It's also sort of the netbook entry for Apple, at least as far as size goes.</p>
<p>Any crazy hopeful rumours or dreams you'd like to see sooner rather than later from Apple?</p>
