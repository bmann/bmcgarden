Dave pointed me to <a href="">interceptvector's XML weather</a>, and then I found <a href="http://www.cruelacid.com/?page=weather">some code</a> that will parse it for me, so the weather block is back, in a smaller, more compact form.

Also, I found <a href="http://www.mouken.com/rss/">a good PHP RSS parser</a>, so I have now again split out <a href="/~boris/">my personal blog</a>, for those that are avidly following my life only...
