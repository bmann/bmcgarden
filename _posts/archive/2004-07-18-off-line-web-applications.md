<p>The only downside to this I can see is that as the gap between "desktop" and "web based" applications closes, users won't understand the difference.  The Oddpost client, for example, feels like a fancy mail and RSS application.  But take it offline (such as cross-country flight) and suddenly it does a lot less that one might expect.  Knowing that it's a web-based system with most of the data stored on the server, this comes as no shock to most anyone reading this.  But to average folks like my Mom, well... that's probably a whole different story.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how we're going to bridge the gap or if that gap will become irrelevant as the odds of having an Internet connection in any random location continue to increase.</p>

<p>We need to improve on the end-user experience with web applications. Or maybe we <em>can</em> go beyond the web? So what's the strategy for storing data and interacting with it -- when we are offline. </p>
