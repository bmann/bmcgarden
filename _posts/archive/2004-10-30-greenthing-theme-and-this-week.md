<p>Thanks to <a href="http://home.ericscouten.com">Eric Scouten</a> (who I met, but didn't get much of a chance to talk to, AND didn't even manage to buy beer for!), here is the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/12334">Greenthing</a> theme. It only has one right hand column, which means there is a ton of information shoved in there. I've been experimenting with adding a left column that goes all the way to the top</p>

<p>This week has been very, very hectic. I don't even think that's completely the right word. Lots of meetings, lots of dinners, lots of thinking. It was great to meet so many people in the flesh. <a href="http://www.walkah.net">James</a> put it best -- for what we crammed into barely 5 days, we could easily have used 2 weeks. There is lots to digest (literally and figuratively) and I continue to be excited about the direction things are going...even if it is a bit tiring at times.</p>

<p>And yes, feel free to post comments/complaints/suggestions about the new look, although I don't expect to be fiddling with it (much) for a while.</p>
