<p>I'm going to be doing a short interview with Global TV with my thoughts on the <a href="http://your.rogers.com/business/productsservices/wireless/blackberrybold.asp">Blackberry Bold, which "launches" today on Rogers</a> (apparently, reports say that the product isn't actually available in stores).</p>

<p>Of course, this is currently a GSM phone, so it's one more piece in Roger's arsenal vs. Telus and Bell, which both have the same set of CDMA phones. The newest phones are released on GSM first, and the CDMA versions lag by months, if they are available at all.</p>

<p>I've never been a huge fan of the Blackberryâ€¦ <strong>as a consumer phone</strong>. I think that's still the case. This is definitely a great upgrade, but unless your company is paying for it, you're more likely to get an iPhone for home use. In addition, the Bold is more expensive with Rogers - $600 without contract, $400 with 3 year contract, vs. $200 (8GB) or $300 (16GB) for the iPhone.</p>

<p>If you're a current Blackberry users that loves the keyboard and scroll wheel, then you'll like this upgrade. Otherwise, we're waiting for the Blackberry Thunder (the touchscreen version) to potentially be "more like the iPhone".</p>
