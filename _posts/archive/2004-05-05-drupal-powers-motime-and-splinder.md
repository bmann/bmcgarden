<p>The main point is that they've found it very easy to develop custom modules to extend functionality, showcasing the fact that Drupal's core is very well written. Read on for a quote and link to the full posting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The largest current installation of Drupal 4.4.0 in terms of community size has recently been upgraded to V.2.0. The common code for this blogging community powers <a href="http://www.motime.com/">motime.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tipic.com/">tipic.com</a> (in English) and <a href="http://www.splinder.it/">splinder.it</a> (in Italian). Among them, there are more than 180,000 registered users.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting aspects of the Splinder/Motime project is the way that it takes advantage of a series of stand-alone modules written by Tipic, Inc. which showcase the flexibility of Drupal's module-based architecture.<p>
