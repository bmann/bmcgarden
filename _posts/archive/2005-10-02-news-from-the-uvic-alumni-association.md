<p>I just gave a young woman calling from the <a href="http://alumni.uvic.ca/" target="_self">UVic Alumni Association</a> a bit of a hard time, as I do anyone calling me unsolicited.</p><p>I asked a bit about their online progress. It turns out you can <a href="http://alumni.uvic.ca/" target="_self">donate online</a>, although predictably the entire site seems to be kept up to date using manual updates and Dreamweaver templates.</p><p>What would I like from my Alumni association? Well, a Web 2.0 website with profiles of my former classmates would be nice, as well as the option to subscribe to news via RSS. Perhaps that's asking a bit much. I'm stilling following <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_self">LinkedIn</a> with interest: they actually manage some group affiliations, like these <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/static?key=groups_directory_acadalumni" target="_self">alumni associations</a>.</p><p>But, I guess I only get to complain if I get involved and try and help out. Time to go find out who to contact at UVic.&nbsp;</p>
