In an industry starting to see more than its share of conferences again with less-than-inspiring speakers, the<a href="http://www.gstconferences.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi"> 2004 Canadian Telecom Summit</a> has managed to come up with an impressive list of speakers. The agenda includes Cisco CEO John Chambers, Nortel CEO Bill Owens, Telus CEO Darren Entwistle and CRTC chair Charles Dalfen. Chambers is clearly the star attraction given how his company dominates the telecom equipment industry and has its sights set on the telecom sector. But Owens&#39; first public speech since taking over as Nortel&#39;s CEO in April should be interesting from a public relations and strategic perspective.

<p>Lot's of interesting people going to be there, as Evans points out. But the site is terrible! Is there going to be updated content? Will there be transcripts and/or presentations posted? Here's hoping, but it doesn't look like it.</p>
