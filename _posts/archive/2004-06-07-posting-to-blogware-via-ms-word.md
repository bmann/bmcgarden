<P>So I guess my question for Mr. Gates is this. </P><P align=center><STRONG>"When&nbsp;will Word&nbsp;be able to effectively publish to&nbsp;Blogware?"</STRONG></P>

<p><a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a> <strike>can do</strike> does this today with <a href="http://www.kunal.org/outlookmt/">Kunal's Outlook MT</a>. Shouldn't be too hard to extend to other systems given support for APIs.</p>

<p>It will be a while before we see more effective use. I would say that desktop-to-weblog/RSS tools are still in pretty early stages (translation: they all suck).</p>
