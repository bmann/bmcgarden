<p>I was just talking about <a href="http://www.taskspro.com/">Tasks Pro</a> today with <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a>. I tried out the original single-user version, <a href="http://www.alexking.org/software/tasks">Tasks</a>, and was pretty happy with it.</p>

<p>We both talked about how we think/write in outlines, but it doesn't actually seem to work that well for tracking stuff. Tasks is currently the forgotten step-daughter of my electronic world. My phone handles contacts and calendaring, but the tasks part doesn't seem to work for me.</p>

<p>Maybe it's time to give something like this a try. I still like <a href="http://www.php-collab.com/">PHP Collab</a> as a project management tool, but there is something to be said for easy, light interfaces. And RSS feeds and iCal support everywhere, of course.</p>
