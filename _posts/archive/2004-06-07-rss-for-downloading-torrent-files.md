<blockquote>Nucleus will download a specified RSS file, and look for .torrent files that match any of the specified keywords. If a match is found it will queue up that file for download. After it has gone through the entire RSS file it will download each file 1 at a time. If no matches are found the program will just simply exit.</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is incredible. Sometimes I wish I had a big pot of money just laying around to throw at <strike>Mac</strike> developers to push apps and services forward. Hmmm...maybe Brent at <a href="http://www.ranchero.com">Ranchero</a> wants to put this in NNW.</p>
