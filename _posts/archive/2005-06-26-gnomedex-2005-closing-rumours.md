<p>Gnomedex 2005 has wrapped, and Roland and I are driving north heading back to Vancouver, discussing our experiences at the conference. My <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann">Bryght blog</a> has all the things I posted during the conference. I posted a lot more than I thought I would, even with shaky WiFi connectivity, lots of intense sessions and hallway meetings.</p>

<p>I thought I would come back over here and pass on a couple of rumours:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google is readying people search capabilities. Typing in a person's name in proper caps and clicking on "I'm feeling lucky" makes...interesting things happen. Think about it!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailysourcecode.com/">Adam Curry</a> was overwhelmed by the Vancouver presence at Gnomedex. He's moving from Amsterdam to Vansterdam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a rumour: no <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/21354028/">bears</a> or fish were harmed at the <a href="http://www.edgewaterhotel.com">Edgewater Hotel</a>.</p>
