<p>Dave Winer is <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/01/13#When:10:16:33AM">still talking</a> about coming up with a system. We have the <a href="http://purl.org/net/syndication/subscribe/">Syndication Subscription Service</a>. Any reason not to use it?</p>

<p>Other than hanging on to a copy of my OPML (why would I want that?), what's different about Dave's proposal?</p>
