<p>The <a target="_self" href="http://wiki.bryght.com/events/innovation-commons-second-meeting">second Innovation Commons meeting</a> is tonight, Wednesday, October 26th, at 6:30pm, at Take 5 Cafe.<br /> </p><p>Bill MacEwen is going to present the work he's done over the past couple of months to develop a business oriented around the same concept, which he calls &quot;WorkSpace&quot;.</p><p>We can kick around some of the names and maybe take a straw poll on it, get a list of services that people would potentially be interested in, and then start working on a survey that can be posted for others to fill out. As always, add other ideas to the <a target="_self" href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/innovation-commons">wiki</a> -- hope to see you tonight.</p><p>Here's an <a href="webcal://wiki.bryght.com/event/ical/all/57" target="_self">iCal feed</a> if you want to subscribe to these events, BTW.&nbsp;</p>
