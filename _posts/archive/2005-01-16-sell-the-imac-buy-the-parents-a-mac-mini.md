title: Sell the iMac, buy the parents a Mac Mini?

<p>My 3-year old iMac 800 is still (according to <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/stats/imac_800_fp.html">EveryMac</a>) worth $1000US. I paid $1800 for it new. Somehow, with a $499US Mac Mini waiting in the wings, that seems a bit crazy.</p>

<p>Of course the iMac has a 15&quot; flat panel monitor, Apple Pro Speakers, and keyboard and mouse. And it's upgraded with an extra 512MB of RAM.</p>

<p>Still, I'm thinking of selling/trading in the iMac rather than passing it on to the <a href="http://www.sevenhillsbnb.com">parentals</a>. It might end up being cheaper that way.</p>
