<p>I just created a new section in my handbook called <a href="/recommended-links">Recommended Links</a>. Before, I only had one link, Troy Angrignon's post on the <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2005/6/19/955532.html">mental evolution that people go through from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>I've just added a second: <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/09/05/why_web20_matte.html">Danah Boyd's post on Why Web 2.0 matters</a>, where she goes through more of the social and business changes taken place that are being aided/accelerated by technology.</p>

<p>And yes, there is <a href="Http://www.whatsweb20.com">What is Web 2.0</a> as well. This is my corner where I can send people a single link and tell them to read the posts linked there, then come back and talk.</p>
