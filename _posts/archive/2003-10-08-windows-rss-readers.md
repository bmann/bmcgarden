<a href="http://www.smithdm3.com">Dave</a> recently said that he is no longer happy with <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/">Feed Reader</a>. Since I walk on the Mac side of life, I didn't have an answer as to what other Windows RSS readers are out there, except for <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a>, which is a plugin for Outlook.

Somewhere I was surfing ended me up at <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">Feed Demon</a>. The other product that Bradbury Software sells is <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">TopStyle</a>, an absolutely amazing CSS/HTML editor.

Anyone have other Windows-based RSS reader suggestions?
