<a href="http://www.jluster.org/node/221">J Luster recently wrote about Gentoo's keychain</a> and I've been using it more in conjunction with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. I'm trying <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/">SSHKeyChain</a>, a nice, GUI-based Mac OS X solution.

I also found the <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/mirrors/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO-4.html">SSH with Keys HOWTO</a> useful.

For Subversion, you'll want Martin Ott's <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/" title="Mac OS X Subversion">Subversion pkg</a>, and you can watch his <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/plan/">blog</a> for updates on that as well as <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> (he's one of the three "Coding Monkeys").

I tried to find a Mac OS X binary of <a href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">RapidSVN</a>, a visual SVN tool -- compiling with the various dependencies looks like a big job. <a href="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/features/">svnx</a> is another visual tool, which is why I started fiddling with SSH keys in the first place.

(I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1242">linked to Bill Bumgarner's page earlier</a>, but didn't say much; Subversion is good, me like.)
