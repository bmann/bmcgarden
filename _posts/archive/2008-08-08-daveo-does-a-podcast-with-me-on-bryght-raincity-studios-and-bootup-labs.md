<p><a href="http://uncleweed.com">Dave Olson</a> sat down with me at the beginning of this week and did a long (50 minutes) <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/raincity-radio/the-boris-speaks-bryght-drupal-boot-and-vancouver-raincity-radio">podcast over at Raincity Radio</a>.</p>

<p>We covered a lot of ground. Here are some short notes with related links on what we talked about:</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
<li>I first met DaveO down in Seattle at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> 2005</li>
<li>DaveO asks me about the start of Bryght -- me, Adrian, Roland, and James, supported by funding from <a href="http://lancetracey.com">Lance Tracey</a></li>
<li>The early days of my involvement with Drupal and how that moved into Bryght: hostmaster, install profiles (first created in D4.5, took all the way to D5 to get into core!)</li>
<li>we decided at Bryght to support the organic growth of the community and helping to stimulate a business ecosystem. A good post is <a href="http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2008/04/24/organic-vs-non-organic-open-source/">organic vs. non organic open source</a></li>
<li>one of the big questions was "Why did you sell Bryght?". The answer is two fold. One, it became a combined product (Drupal hosting) and services (R&D and contract consulting work) company, trending ever more towards services. This was just not something I was personally interested in. Two, I felt an itch to scratch about continuing to support the growth of the local Vancouver tech community, and ultimately it became clear that <a href="http://bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs</a> was the right vehicle to do that with.</li>
<li><a href="http://bryght.com">Bryght</a> re-launched. It looks beautiful and I had almost nothing to do with it. Oh, and you can now get Bryght Light in Chinese, or even pay nothing for it as an ad-supported version.</li>
<li>Yes, there are more new services coming from Bryght, including Canadian based servers as an option. Much of it will be due to <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/about/team/narayan-newton">Narayan Newton</a>.</li>
<li>there is a big chunk in the middle about what my new startup, <a href="http://bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs</a></li>
 <li>there are Drupal events coming up that you should go to. In a couple of weeks there is <a href="http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/">Drupalcon Szeged</a>, and in early September there is <a href="http://drupalcamp.northstudio.com/">Drupalcamp Victoria</a> ... combined with the Great Canadian Beerfest!</li>
<li>The design firm for the Drupal.org redesign has been chosen. This is going to be a BIG job, but remember, Drupal.org is *our* home -- this is something that will benefit everyone, and everyone should be looking at how to help with this.</li>
<li>Call to action: help get Drupal.org upgraded to Drupal 6. One of the (minor but important) patches near and dear to my heart is the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/157514">infamous XML patch to project*</a></li>
<li>Shout out to <a href="http://drupal.org/user/72806">VeryMisunderstood</a> aka Kenn, who does a ton of work helping out in the forums</li>
</ul>
