<p>Translation: I think I managed to screw up several hard drives.</p><p>I have had a Maxtor external drive for quite some time (like 3 years or so?). Its main job was to hold our entire iTunes collection attached to the desktop (<a href="/node/1437" target="_self">Gigantor</a>) we have at home. Yes, note the use of &quot;was&quot;. I should have listened more closely when Kate said iTunes wouldn't let her do certain things. Turns out those were symptoms of a drive that was going bad.</p><p>I ended up recovering some of it by purchasing <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/" target="_self">Alsoft's DiskWarrior</a>. Kate is paranoid (luckily) so she has backups on DVD in a safety deposit box. I also had a recent backup on another hard drive. Yep, another external one, for which I have a FireWire external enclosure that I just swap bare drives through.</p><p>It mounted, I was browsing files, and sure enough, that directory called &quot;Music (Backup)&quot; was there. Except, then, it wasn't. A system error about the disk being put away improperly. And the drive was/is toast, at least with the external enclosure I have, using the Oxford 911 chipset. There was of course the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/panfirewire.html#oxford" target="_self">Panther Firewire Bug</a>, but it seems there are some <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/incompatibility.html" target="_self">Tiger incompatibilities</a> with some external enclosures as well.</p><p>Ouch. That'll teach me to try and do computer fixes early in the morning before I've had my first coffee. So, lessons learned -- if you notice any &quot;funny&quot; behaviour, immediately backup data (that was before the Maxtor went south). Secondly, if you notice *anything* funny with drives unmounting, unplug/power down the drive and do not touch them again or try and repeat the procedure. I may have actually nuked two drives in a row with this...I'm not sure yet until I get a different enclosure to test them with <img border="0" src="/hm/profiles/standard/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-yell.gif" /></p><p><span class="image medium"><img width="320" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="256" border="0" align="left" title="RAIDTech 800 Product Image" alt="RAIDTech 800 Product Image" src="/system/files?file=images/drupal//hr8_lg.medium.jpg" /></span>This was a painful lesson. I have had &quot;get proper backup solution&quot; on my to do list for a while. What I really want is an external firewire hot-swappable hardware RAID solution, like the <a target="_self" href="http://www.wiebetech.com/products/RAIDTech800.php">RAIDTech800</a> from WiebeTech (which I suspect is made by a company in Victoria called Synetic -- the box there is the <a href="http://www.synetic.net/Synetic-Products/SyneRAID-Units/SyneRAID-XFW-XSC.htm" target="_self">Stardom 3600</a> -- $640CDN). This is not cheap, but it's pretty much bulletproof. A cheaper option might be something like the <a href="http://www.wiebetech.com/products/Baydock800.php" target="_self">WiebeTech BayDock 800</a> - 2 or 4 drive enclosures, Mac OS X software RAID (<a href="http://www.macsonly.com/arch00404.html#261" target="_self">review at Macs only</a>). But, that doesn't solve backup -- with hot-swap, you can get three drives all with drive trays, and always keep one off site.&nbsp;</p>
