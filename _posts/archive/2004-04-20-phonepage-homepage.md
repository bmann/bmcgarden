<blockquote>
A phonepage is a homepage for mobile phones stored on the Internet and linked to a specific phone number. Our technology enables automatic display of phonepages at phone calls. A phonepage converts automatically to any mobile phone format e.g. WAP, Pocket PC or i-mode - in color or B/W. In addition, we have developed a solution to push phonepages automatically to mobile phones.

<p>I think the <a href="http://my.no/index.jsp">service itself</a> could do with a facelift, but the idea is very interesting. Don't know when North America will get to the point where there are enough smartphones around.</p>
