<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> membership/t-shirt combo a <a href="/node/1237">long long time ago</a>, and didn't get my shirt yet.</p>

<p>I compared notes recently with <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> and <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com">Richard</a> â€” and they didn't get their shirts either!</p>

<p>Turns out cross border t-shirt shipping doesn't always work that great, but John, horrified to hear that his Canadian fans might be going t-shirt-less in the winter, got on the case. And here's me wearing my new DF shirt:</p>

<p>Next stop: DF in Europe! Actually, I think John should have a contest: best photo of a DF t-shirt somewhere cool.</p>
