As the communication industry press starts to understand the significance of [co-founder and CEO of Skype, Niklas Zennstrom's] presence at our conference, I expect the number of press requests to attend VON Canada 2004 to just continue to rise.

<p>Hmmm...wonder if Jeff will let me attend as part of the "blogging press". Look at all the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/topics/voip">VoIP</a> stuff I publish!</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Much like the low level of education around VoIP in general, there are many people that haven't heard about <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> either. Jeff's right when he says that Zennstrom's presence will cause some press interest, and likely raise the level of awareness.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> going to try to make it to VON Canada one way or another.</p>
