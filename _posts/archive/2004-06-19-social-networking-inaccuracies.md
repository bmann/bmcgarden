Brad Howarth's ZDNet Australia article, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/0,39023166,39150883,00.htm">Social networking tools face uncertain future</a>, completely misses the mark.  It would be one thing if it were just another rant about the supposed lack of a business model for social networking sites, but this one is so chock full of inaccuracies as to be worthy of comment:

<p>I rant about the lack of business models, but the ZDNet article does have a bunch of errors -- follow the link to read the inaccuracy/correction list at Online Business Networks. It also serves as a good summary of some of the major points about social networking.</p>
