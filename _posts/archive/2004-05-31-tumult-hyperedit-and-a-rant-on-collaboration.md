<blockquote>
Tumult HyperEdit is a lightweight HTML editor with a preview pane that displays the web page live as you type. HyperEdit breaks the tedious cycle of writing html, saving the file, then reloading and viewing the page in the browser by combining the writing phase with the viewing phase. This clarifies the effects of your changes and speeds up the overall process of making a web page. W3C-based validation will red-underline any mistakes. It uses the same rendering engine found in Safari, so it is not only standards compliant, but also very fast.

<p>This looks like a great app. Now that I'm back to posting with Ecto (bought and paid for, as of today), I'm tired of looking at <a href="http://www.padawan.info/weblog/rant_fuc_weblog_software.html" title="What You See Is F*cking Ugly Code">WYSIFUC</a>. I don't want a "preview" button, I want to see what things are going to look like as I type them. And I actually don't want to worry about the details of writing XHTML -- I want a rich text editor. And all those non-HTML markup languages are just as bad -- just different syntax for me to memorize, and all subtly different enough that you lose your mind if you have to work with more than one of them in different places.</p>

<p>I'm also testing <a href="http://www.near-time.com/products/overview.htm">Near Time Flow</a> -- think of it as <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> combined with <a href="http://www.clevercactus.com/">Clever Cactus Share</a>, with a few rough edges.</p>

<p>Or, as <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy</a> put it the other day -- why isn't there a simple, cross-platform tool that allows us to collaboratively edit in real-time using rich text? Can we start a fund to get SubEthaEdit to support RTF and make a cross-platform version using <a href="http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/" title="Howl - Cross-platform Zeroconf / Rendezvous Library">Howl</a>? (Troy will post more about this soon, hopefully) </p>
