<p>Currently Windows only, and the <a href="http://voipail.blogspot.com/">blog says</a> the beta test begin smid-November. You can sign up for beta testing on the <a href="http://www.voipail.com">main site</a>. Yes, I don't like the name either.</p>

<p>I'm drowning under voicemail, and have real trouble managing it. I get a lot of email as well, but it's much easier to handle and organize there. I would pay for a voicemail only service that delivered it via email.</p>

<p>I <strong>am</strong> about to start testing something, but I can't talk about it yet. I'm going to point it at my  Gmail account. Heck, it would be a good way to do podcasting.</p>
