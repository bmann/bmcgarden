<p>I spent a little bit of time tonight plotting markers for the itinerary of my <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/class-afloat-1993-1994">Class Afloat 1993-1994 trip</a>, where I sailed around the North and South Pacific on a tall ship.</p>

<p>The new "My Maps" feature of Google Maps is pretty easy to use, and I've been. Here's the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?uid=106678119088828437419&hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=108403776136895878523.00043d0abf1f2178340aa">public view of the map</a> so far.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to do more with this, now that it looks like <a href="http://www.scancafe.com">Scan Cafe</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/10/scancafe-scan-your-photos-negatives-and-slides-cheaply.html">Darren</a>) can fairly cheaply scan my 600 slides from that trip. It will be great to have a digital representation online at last (it's been 14 years!). I do happen to have a couple of photos up of varying quality <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/tags/classafloat">tagged with 'class afloat' in my Flickr stream</a>.</p>
