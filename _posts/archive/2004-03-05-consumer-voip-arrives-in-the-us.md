<p>When something hits retail stores is when mass market popularity explodes. <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is currently at around 300K subscribers, and this deal with Circuit City to carry startup packages is likely to rapidly increase that number:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who sign up at the electronics giant will save $100. An adapter from Circuit City costs $100, but Vonage will offer the first two months of service free — a $70 savings — and waive the $30 activation fee.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The key factor here for consumers seems to be cost: consumer VoIP providers can offer the same services (or better ones, like multiple phone numbers in different cities) at an overall lower cost.</p>

<p>I still want <em>different</em> services: voice mail via email, a softphone, conferencing, etc.</p>
