<p>I've just finished watching all of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">The IT Crowd</a> episodes that I can find (<a href="http://www11.alluc.org/alluc/tv-shows.html?action=getviewcategory&category_uid=901">AllUC link</a>)</p>

<p>It's another British office comedy, focused around an IT department that works out of the basement. A definite mix of that uncomfortable feeling plus ridiculous comedy in the style of The Office. Worth watching, now I just have to find more episodes and/or wait for Series 2?</p>
