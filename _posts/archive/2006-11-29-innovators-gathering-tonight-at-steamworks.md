<p>Jenny Yang organized another get together over beer tonight &ndash; Wednesday, Nov. 29th &ndash; at Steamworks at 5pm (entry on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/128802/">upcoming.org</a>).</p><p>See a <a href="/blog/bmann/innovation-in-vancouver-funded-by-the-bdc">previous post</a> on how this came to be, which also talked about the potential for a <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">Demo Camp Vancouver</a>. Follow that link and you&#39;ll see that Megan Cole has now picked up that torch and is going to kick off a first Demo Camp in the new year.</p><p>It&#39;s snowy and cold outside, and while you might not want to venture outside, you&#39;ve probably been huddling indoors for days now. Come hoist a beverage with us down at Steamworks instead... </p>
