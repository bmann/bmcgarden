<p>We're currently looking for both <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">speaker submissions</a> and <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca/ideas">speaker ideas</a>. I think I can honestly say that I'm at a bit of a loss on thinking about what the new new is. Or perhaps it is time to just refine and expand on previous threads and ideas? I do know that my thinking about geolocation was ahead of the curve from last year...I don't even think we'll quite be there for this year.</p>

<p>What *will* be there? Lots of interesting people. How to's and getting started in various areas, from blogs to wikis to digital photos. Open and participatory discussions, and all sorts of fruitful hallway conversations and ad hoc meetings. Some parties, some travel bursaries. High bandwidth tech-people-idea overload. Looking forward to it, and hope you'll join us.</p>

<p>Here are the obligatory <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=7155707537">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/312783">Upcoming</a> events that you can show your attendance with -- we'll be opening official registration in a couple of weeks.</p>
