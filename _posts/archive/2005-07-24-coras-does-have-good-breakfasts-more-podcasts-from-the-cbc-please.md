<p>Dave was in Ottawa and had breakfast at Cora's. My guess is the one on <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&client=safari&rls=en&q=cora%27s+breakfast&near=Ottawa,+ON,+Canada&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=45352088,-75723440,15880405067924037563">Merivale</a>, on his way up from the 401.</p>

I had one of the best breakfasts of my life at a restaurant called Cora's in Ottawa. Maybe it was because I like Ottawa so much, or did some really great work on my walk just before breakfast, or maybe it's because the food was incredibly well prepared. I don't know but, it was pretty great

<p>I noticed the mention because there was an interview on CBC recently with the founder of Cora's -- initially a completely family run chain in Quebec, and now a franchise. The food *is* really good. The point being, I wish that all of the CBC's programming was available as podcasts. Of course, when I played <a href="http://www.cbcradio3.com/podcast/list.cfm?year=2005&Playlist_Id=9">Episode #9 from the CBC Radio 3 podcast</a>...it kind of sucked (I've liked the rest of them so far). But still...more, please.</p>
