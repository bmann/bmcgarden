<a href="http://brighthand.com/article/Wi-Fi_MemoryStick_Coming_This_Summer">BrightHand reports</a> that Sony is preparing WiFi adapters in MemoryStick format. They already produced some CF adapters for their really high-end series, but this means that all the (recent) Clies should be able to do WiFi.

Yes, please. Ship it right over when you've got it finished.

Of course, I wouldn't mind the Bluetooth version either, but last I heard, they were selling for something like $400CDN. Plus, I would still need a Bluetooth adapter for my computer, which is another $100 or so.

And Bluetooth is going to get blown away by UWB, according to many.
