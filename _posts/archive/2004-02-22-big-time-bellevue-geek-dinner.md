<p>Mmm. YahooMaps says <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?ed=8OhuueV.winIG2pAshQv5Z3qzd81.HmHxjGmiMBJdw--&csz=Vancouver%2C+BC%2C+V6H+1J4&country=ca&tcsz=Bellevue%2C+WA&tcountry=us">2hrs, 40min</a>. Maybe less if <a href="http://www.terranomicsdevelopment.com/crossroads.htm">Crossroads</a> is on the outskirts. Not <strong>that</strong> crazy of an idea, given that we might go to <a href="http://www.mtbakerskiarea.com/">Mount Baker</a> (which we can see on a clear day) next weekend.</p>

<p>Have to remember my current mission, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>???</li>
<li>Get "real job"</li>
<li>Paycheck</li>
</ol>
