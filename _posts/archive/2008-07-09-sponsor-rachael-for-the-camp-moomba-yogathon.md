She&#39;s look for a few more <a href="http://www.gifttool.com/athon/MyFundraisingPage?ID=1237&amp;AID=230&amp;PID=36764">sponsor donations to reach her goal</a>. As you can see from the picture at left...you won&#39;t like her when she&#39;s angry, so please <a href="http://www.gifttool.com/athon/MyFundraisingPage?ID=1237&amp;AID=230&amp;PID=36764">donate</a>. I don&#39;t want to have to show you my bruises...</p>

<p>What&#39;s a yogathon and what is this for? <a href="http://rachaelashe.com/2008/07/08/vancouver-yogathon-four-days-to-go/">Rachael blogged the 4 day countdown</a>, where she explains:</p>  <blockquote style="color: #4d5359; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 16px">The yogathon means a 108 minute long session of yoga for the thousands of people who participate. The funds raised through the event go towards sending children whose lives have been affected by HIV/AIDS to <a href="http://www.campmoomba.com/">Camp Moomba</a>, to give them a chance at a normal summer of fun. This will be my third time participating, and it’s something I look forward to taking part in every summer if I can. Last year we did the yogathon in heavy rain, which was not something I was expecting to <a  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goddess_spiral/870543850/">enjoy</a> as much as I did.
</blockquote>

<p>So there you go. I've done a short yoga session all about once, so I won't be yogathoning. I'm not sure what the support team does at these events. Eat hemp ice cream at the blissfest, I expect.</p>

<p>And, of course, once again my personal life and Drupal community collide: the <a href="http://www.ghostbrothers.com">Ghost Brothers</a> are playing music at the yogathon, and I got given one of their CDs from <a href="http://graviteklabs.com/">Chris Bryant of Gravitek Labs</a>. Ha! And that new email I just got was a Facebook notification from Chris letting me know that <a href="http://www.facebook.com/n/?event.php&amp;eid=18363247479">the Ghost Brothers are playing with DNA6 on July 24th</a>. Small world...</p>
