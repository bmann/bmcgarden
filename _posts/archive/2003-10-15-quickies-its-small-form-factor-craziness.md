<p>I want to keep some sort of track of the tiny boxes that are floating around out there, but apparently somebody has decided that this is the way of the future (actually, I agree). So, a bunch of links to reviews about various small form factor (a.k.a. SFF) PCs. Some are nothing more than small cubes, while others are leaning more to the "stereo component" look.</p>

<p>After reading through the articles and the specs, my 1Ghz Duron seems pretty low-powered. Well, it <em>is</em> low-powered! I'll get a new PC for testing in 2006, when Longhorn ships. Now click the read more link for the article URLs.</p>

Conclusion seems to be that you can get a lot of the components for cheaper, but the look/style may very well count for a lot. Are the companies that make these boxes running the same equation and reallizing that "style" has higher margins?</li>

And a giant "volume knob". And Serial ATA?! I gues it shouldn't be surprising that this box is high-performance, since it is being reviewed by an over-clocking site...</li>
