<p>I just posted a <a href="http://www.odesk.com/jobs/Drupal-theme-port-from-Drupal_~~a3d74de0cacb6a5b?tot=1&amp;pos=0">job on oDesk looking for someone to help get AdHack from&nbsp;Drupal 5 to Drupal 6</a>. Here's the cut n paste of the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are migrating our existing website from Drupal 5 to Drupal 6 and need an expert Drupal themer to help with the conversion of the theme.<br />
<br />
The current live site is available for review at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="You are about to go to a URL outside odesk.com" class="extlink" href="http://www.odesk.com/leaving_odesk.php?ref=http%3A%2F%2Fadhack.com">http://adhack.com</a><br />
<br />
It runs on Drupal 5 and uses common Drupal modules such as CCK and Views.<br />
<br />
We already have the Acquia version of Drupal 6 running on a development server. This is an initial port so we can migrate to Drupal 6 and add more features over time. This may lead to on going contract work in theming and light development.<br />
<br />
Skills required:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Existing portfolio and experience with Drupal 6 theming.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Drupal theming</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>HTML</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>CSS</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>PHP</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>custom work with the template.php file</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>customization with Views module</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The main skills needed here are familiarity with both the Drupal 5 theming system and the Drupal 6 theming differences.&nbsp;There are lots of custom views with accompanying snippets in the template.php. This is an initial port so that we can get everything running on D6, and then optimize from there.</p>
<p>It's my estimation that this would be about 20 hours of work for someone that charges $25 an hour, or 10 hours of work for someone that charges $50 per hour :P This is an hourly job, that's just my estimate of what a first cut port would take.</p>
<p>If you're a developer but know the theming layer, this would be a good fit: there is more development-centric work to be done on various custom bits and pieces.</p>
