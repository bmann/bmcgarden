<p>That's the search results for this site. Hard to read, but in the full version there are "View as XML" and "Add to My Yahoo" links. Yahoo sees that I've added special tags to my header which points to the location of my syndicated feeds -- my <a href="http://www.bmannconslting.com/node/feed">front page feed</a> (which is everything that makes it onto the front page) and the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/feed" title="B. Mann Consulting Blog Feeds">blog feeds</a> (which is a combined feed of everyone that posts to their blog here -- everyone also has their own blog feed).</p>

<p>Yahoo has also recently switched to using its own search engine, instead of relying on Google. At the same time, Google made a press release today that they are crawling over a billion pages -- the largest of any search engine.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> speaking of RSS, the <a href="http://www.onlinebusinessnetworks.com/blog/2004/2/19/yahoo-and-rss-and-yahoo-groups">Online Business Blog</a> mentions that Yahoo Groups are now accessible as RSS feeds. No more mailing listsâ€¦</p>
