<p>I dropped by Tod Maffin's favourite alleyway on Tuesday morning, and he grabbed a few soundbites from me about the <a href="http://www.freethenet.ca">FreeTheNet.ca community wireless project</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.todmaffin.com/blog/freethenet">audio is online now</a>, and the clip will air tomorrow (Thursday, October 11th, 2007). The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/spark/blog/2007/10/community_wifi.html">CBC's Spark blog has a short mention, too</a>.</p>

<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with how the piece turned out. I didn't quite expect the whole thing to be about FreeTheNet -- Tod had originally mumbled something about additional wireless stuff, but turns out it's all about free wireless. The stress on "free" was a little strong...the interesting part really is when we can find a great ISP partner who sees the logic in promoting wider coverage, more customers, and the opportunity for additional applications by such coverage.</p>

<p>Thanks for the opportunity, Tod!</p>
