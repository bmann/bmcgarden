<p>I just confirmed that I'll be on <a href="http://www.cknw.com/shows/show_christyclark.cfm">CKNW 980's The Christy Clark Show</a> tomorrow afternoon (Wednesday, October 3rd, at 1:30pm).</p>

<p>I'll be talking about <a href="http://vancouver.freethenet.ca">Vancouver's FreeTheNet.ca</a> project. As <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a> warned us, we're getting a fair bit of attention quite soon, which could be a bit problematic for a grass roots project. Incidentally, our second meeting is tonight (<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/269672/">info on Upcoming</a>) -- please come out if you are interested in getting involved or finding out more.</p>

<p>More background on Christy Clark and her show on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Clark">Wikipedia</a> and her <a href="http://christyclark.ca/">website</a>.</p>
