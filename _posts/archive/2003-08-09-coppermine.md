Whenever anyone has asked me for an image gallery, my answer has always been <a href="/node/view/23">Gallery</a>. However, it's HTML is pretty crufty. Lately, several people have told me to check out Coppermine. Including a lengthy discussion on the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/view/1009">Drupal site</a>.

Now I just have to try it out myself.
