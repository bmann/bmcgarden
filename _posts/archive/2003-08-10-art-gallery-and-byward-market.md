<p><img src="/images/paper_papier.jpg" alt="Paper Papier Business Card" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">Kate and I went for a nice walk around the city. We stopped in at Perfect Books to buy some poems by Colin Vincent (brother to <a href="http://www.kelprecords.com/bands/av/">Andrew</a>) and also ended up getting some Celtic rubber stamps. The lady there told use we could get cool inks at a new shop, <a href="http://www.paperpapier.com/">Paper-Papier</a>. Well, new at that location -- looks like they have been here since 1982.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nag_receipts.jpg" alt="NAG Receipts" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Next we were off to the <a href="http://national.gallery.ca">National Art Gallery</a>. We saw the exhibition called "The Art of Watteau, Chardin, Fragonard". Plus some Dutch and Flemish Drawings. That's my Friend of the Gallery card -- Kate got us a family membership for this year, and we've made good use of it.</p>

<p>Also, I asked about the photos I saw last time, of industrial landscapes and the shipbreaking. They are by <a href="http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/">Edward Burtynsky</a>. The gift shop didn't have any art cards left, just a giant/expensive catalog book. That link has some good images, though, plus some more <a href="http://www.godardgallery.com/burt.htm">here</a>. Turns out it was <em>not</em> Port Blair as I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/355">was thinking</a> -- it's Chittagong, Bangladesh.</p>
