<p><a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">KK</a> and I had to travel over to Victoria for a <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/tsa/" title="we met with some ministerial types">meeting</a>. At the last minute, we put out a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/5248">call to come together and hang out at Smith's Pub</a>.</p>

<p>I think good fun was had by all, the lamb burgers were reason enough to head to Victoria again some time soon.</p>
