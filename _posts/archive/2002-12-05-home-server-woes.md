In the last 24 hours, I have downloaded 3 different distributions that I hoped would serve as an easy to use, easy to configure, home server.

But, at the end of the day, I'm back at <a href="http://www.e-smith.org">E-smith</a>. It's got some annoying bits to it, a certain lack of flexibility in some respects, but that is also its strength: it just works.

I'm going to start small, get a few things working, surf the forums, check out the how-tos. First order of business will be to see if I can get the BIOS on the machine I'm using to recognize the 80GB drive that we bought to store MP3s. Maybe just jumper settings on the *first* drive???
