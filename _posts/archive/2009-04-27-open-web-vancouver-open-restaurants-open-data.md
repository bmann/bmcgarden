<p>I got notice this weekend that my talk submission to <a href="http://openwebvancouver.ca">Open Web Vancouver 2009</a> got accepted.</p>

<p>(BTW Open Web Van peeps - I'm tagging this <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;tag=owv09">#owv09</a>, please post this somewhere as the &quot;official&quot; tag)</p>
<p>I posted my talk submission to the <a href="http://wiki.openrestaurants.org/announcements/talksubmittedtoopenwebvancouver">Open Restaurants wiki</a>. What's Open Restaurants? Well, it's the namespace for that <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/semantic-web-community-barn-raising-vancouver">Semantic Web Community Barn Raising</a> that I blogged about a while back. We had our breakfast meeting, 8 people came, and we've got a great cross section of Drupal devs, Freebase / semweb schema nerds, open data policy enthusiasts, and NLP experts that want to use Twitter posts to create Skynet :P</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I said namespace, because we'll go about creating some schemas and hopefully bootstrap local communities, web apps, and other producers / consumers to adopt this schema and use it to build interesting things. I have some ideas about doing supply chain modeling for a <a href="http://farmfed.com">Farmfed</a> project that <a href="http://farmsteadwines.com">Anthony at Farmstead Wines</a> has gotten me roped into.</p>
<p>I joked about the codename for the mashup we're going to create being called BaconPatioBeer. Except, the more I thought about it &hellip; the more I liked it and couldn't find another URL that seemed perfect. Hence, http://baconpatiobeer.com (which currently redirects to the Open Restaurants wiki). There'll be a blog up, soon~ish. Oh, look, there's this Twitter account, too @openrestaurants</p>
<p>I'm excited about getting the chance to work together with a group of people exploring <a href="http://linkeddata.org">Linked Data</a> concepts directly. The &quot;open data&quot; part is also fascinating, and it looks like we'll actually get a chance to speak to Vancouver's city council in support of the concept - nice work, <a href="http://countablyinfinite.ca">Karen</a>.</p>
<p>So it looks like the &quot;food for robots&quot; phrase that I suggested at Drupalcon is becoming literal, since we're starting with food-related data. In fact, the Lullabots posted an <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/drupal-voices/drupal-voices-17-boris-manns-intro-semantic-web-drupal">audio interview of me talking Drupal + Semantic Web</a>. I, uh, haven't gotten up the nerve to listen to it yet -- it was during the day of my all nighter, and I kind of remember looking up into space and monologuing. For more on Semantic Web/RDF in Drupal, try the next <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/drupal-voices/drupal-voices-18-st%C3%A9phane-corlosquet-semantic-web-drupal">interview with St&eacute;phane Corlosquet</a>.</p>
