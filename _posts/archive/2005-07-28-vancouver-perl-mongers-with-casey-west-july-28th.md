<p>I posted the <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/2311">details on an event listing at Urban Vancouver</a>, but wanted to make notice of it here as well. Luke Closs reads my blog and emailed to invite me. I can't make it tonight, but one of the things that Casey is going to talk about is <a href="http://www.openjsan.org/">JSAN</a>, which is a proposal to make a kind of CPAN for JavaScript.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> is a central repository for a ton of Perl code (it stands for &quot;Comprehensive Perl Archive Network&quot;). Having the same thing for JavaScript would certainly be a very interesting concept, especially with all the AJAX frameworks that seem to be crawling out of the woodwork.</p>

<p>I see that there is going to be a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7486">JSAN BOF at OSCON 2005 in Portland</a>. I'll be attending, and will be mainly posting over at <a href="http://www.bryght.com/events/oscon-2005">Bryght's OSCON coverage</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up, Luke.</p>
