<p>Congratulations to Michael Tippett and family:</p>

<blockquote>
Kate and I are happy to announce the birth of Sylvie Cochrane Tippett.  She was born April 20, 2005, is just shy of 7 pounds, in good health and an expert sleeper (so far). We are both doing well and Hugo has enjoyed getting to know his new little sister.  Photos will soon be posted on <a href="http://www.SylvieTippett.com">www.SylvieTippett.com</a>.

<p>Wow. What a dad -- a new baby girl and her very own URL from birth. Should she get her own <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> accounts as well?</p>

<p>Michael is a Vancouver native and mastermind behind <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com">Now Public</a>. Maybe we'll see him come up for air again in a couple of weeks and we can talk about kids online during a <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Vancouver Beercast</a>.</p>
