<p>This post was jogged by two things. One was seeing the <a href="http://www.jarche.com/?p=775">post by Harold Jarche</a>, who is moving ahead with putting together a Commons as well. The second was experiencing the fantastic space of the <a href="http://www.the215.ca/">Centre for Social Innovation</a> in Toronto (thanks, <a href="http://www.communitybandwith.ca">Philip</a> for getting us this space for DrupalCamp).</p>  <p>So, the <a href="/blog/bmann/the-innovation-commons">Innovation Commons</a> concept <em>has</em> to get built. Bill&#39;s <a href="http://bad.typepad.com/workspace/">Workspace</a> shared office concept is a great solution <em>as a business</em>. But, the Innovation Commons needs to be a mix of businesses, non profits, and perhaps even public-private funding sources. I think the Centre for Social Innovation is a good model, but actually less of a focus on exclusively non-profit businesses. Creative, tech, non profit.</p>  <p>On to action items.</p>  <p>The SFU students that worked on an Innovation Commons business model did produce some good, lengthy documents, Excel spreadsheets, and presentations which really need to be posted in friendly non-proprietary formats and distributed under a Creative Commons license. Nik, I&#39;m looking at you here.</p>  <p>As commons-type initiatives spring up around the world, we can hopefully pool our learnings and go farther faster -- check <a href="http://www.furl.net/members/hjarche/Commons">Harold Jarche&#39;s &quot;Commons&quot; tag on Furl</a>. My eventual hope is that we can have linkages between different commons, so traveling members can connect locally when they are on the road.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com">wiki</a> is OK, but I&#39;ve come to believe that every project needs a URL. A URL is a pivot point around which concepts can form. So, back to the drawing board there -- suggest some names/URLs and I&#39;ll get a wiki-fied site set up that we can centralize resources at (and move the existing stuff from the wiki).</p>  <p>The problem, of course, is finding another slice of time to focus on and champion this initiative. Rather than the large group we have had meeting and talking, we need a smaller handful of people that can actually commit some time. More thoughts on this over time.</p>  <p>(And yes, my dream location would still be buying the Sam the Record Man building on Seymour)</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> it turns out we&#39;re building it Canada wide. I&#39;m amazed that after talking to <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> and <a href="http://remarkk.com">Mark Kuznicki</a>, that we&#39;ve been thinking the exact same thing. Actually, it&#39;s spookier than that -- the business model and actual 3 year plan are nearly identical. So, <a href="http://innovationcommons.ca">innovationcommons.ca</a>, coming soon, David Crow nominated as benevolent Executive Director for life. </p>
