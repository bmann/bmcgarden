<p>I've been getting so much great feedback and comments on my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/795">original post</a> that I decided to open up/create <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/forum">forums</a> here on B. Mann Consulting.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/forum/124">Telephony forum</a> is where to go to chat about VoIP-related items. In particular, I've created an initial <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/834">TalkBroadband discussion topic</a>.</p>

<p>The two other forums are <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/forum/125">Gastronomy</a>, for anything food related, and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/forum/126">BMC</a>, which is basically a default, miscellaneous site forum. Feel free to suggest others.</p>

<p>I'm specifically not creating a Apple/Mac forum, because I want people to use the <a href="http://midgard.bmannconsulting.com/mailman/listinfo/macheads" title="MacHeads -- Mailing list for people that like Macs">MacHeads</a>. As well, e-smith items are well-covered on the <a href="http://contribs.org/">Contribs.org</a> site, which I also read regularly.</p>
