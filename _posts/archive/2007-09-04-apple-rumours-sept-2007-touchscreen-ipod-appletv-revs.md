<p>Everyone loves a good Apple rumours post, and since tomorrow is a "special Apple event", we've got only hours to wait until we know the real answer...hence the perfect time to predict.</p>

<p>What I'd *like* to see is my own long-predicted Mac Tablet. But really, with the iPhone, isn't that product already here? So....what I would like to see is an iPhone without the "phone" part -- a touch screen iPod with Wifi that runs OS X. It really is an iPhone, just without the cellular connection (or contract). But with WiFi, that could mean GoogleTalk / Skype / whatever for voice communications (with my bet on GoogleTalk). Yes, sort of like Nokia's N800.</p>

<p>OK, so back from dream land to something that's more likely. The iPod Nano becomes the "classic" iPod for audio, and a new touchscreen, wide aspect iPod is the "Video iPod". No WiFi, that'll come in later revs.</p>

<p>AppleTV revs? Well, it fits in the general video category, and there's been noise around TV downloads recently. Aside: so NBC is <a href="http://waffle.wootest.net/2007/09/01/pr-speak-nbc-universal/">high as a kite</a>. Regardless, I just want the licensing figured out so I can buy stuff in Canada! Actual details? No idea...probably just software, maybe some gaming support.</p>

<p>What are your predictions? Any purchasing plans? What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> so, we now have an iPod Touch. Sweet. And it comes with Wifi already. Yep, the tablet is here...</p>
