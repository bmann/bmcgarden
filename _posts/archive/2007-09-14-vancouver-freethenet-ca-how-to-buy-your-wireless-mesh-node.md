<p>So, one day later (!!!), our concept of getting <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/vancouver-freethenet-ca-community-wireless-your-neighbourhood#comment-136571">free wireless going in Vancouver</a> is picking up a ton of steam. Here's the map of wireless nodes across Vancouver as of today:</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/1383645464/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1216/1383645464_44820b77b6.jpg" width="500" height="251" alt="vancouver.freethenet.ca" /></a>

<p>I'm going to take a unit home, so there will be a South Granville location, too. Also check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/1382749731/">zoomed-in version of Gastown</a> -- we could have really good coverage in no time.</p>

<p>We had <a href="http://vancouvertechguy.com/free-willy-the-internet">Lyal</a> from <a href="http://www.outcome3.com">Outcome3</a> come and buy a unit, and Jennifer from <a href="http://www.elasticentertainment.com">Elastic Entertainment</a>. Raincity Studios, who are going to be sharing our office here at 1 Alexander, are going to <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/thestandard/free-wi-fi-for-the-people-of-vancouver">unwire their side of the office as well</a>. I'm thinking Chill Winston is going to see some more laptop users soon. I think <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris Krug</a> narrowly beat out Joe Bowser to be the first "home" node up. Wow...and that's day 1!</p>

<h2>How to buy a Meraki wireless mesh node in Vancouver</h2>

<img src="http://bmannconsulting.com/sites/bmannconsulting.com/files/freethenet10.gif" title="FreeTheNet.ca Meraki units in Vancouver"/>

<p>We've currently got a stack of Meraki units from <a href="http://www.geodata.ca">Mike West</a> sitting in the Bryght offices. If you are a business or individual, <a href="http://www.bryght.com">contact Bryght</a> or stop by during business hours and we'll configure a unit and sell it to you. If you're a regular home user, the Meraki Mini will do just fine.</p>

<p>What do you need? Nothing more than a network connection. If you buy more than one, they will automatically form a mesh so you can cover a wider area. Need help configuring? We'll do what we can to get you up and running -- Joe Bowser is our official hardware/network geek.</p>

<p>We'll hurry to get Vancouver.FreeTheNet.ca set up early next week, so we can promote everyone that is running nodes. Ideally, we'll get an interface (and coverage!) like the <a href="http://sf.meraki.com/overview">San Fran network</a>, where we can keep the map updated in real time.</p>
