	Through <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com">Urban Vancouver</a>, I was lucky enough to meet <a href="http://www.rustyvalentine.com">Rusty</a>, a.k.a. Alex. Somehow I got drawn into the crazy web that is &quot;CD Exchange 2&quot;.</p>
<p>
	And so, I give to you my entry:</p>
<!--break-->
<p>
	<strong>Burning Monkey Productions Presents: CDX2</strong></p>
<p>
	Format is: Song Name / Artist Name (Album) Time<br />
	If no album is listed, it is the same as the artist name.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		All Hell For A Basement / Big Sugar (Brothers &amp; Sisters, Are You Ready?) 4:00
		<p>
			I love Big Sugar, from their early, more blue-sy stuff (and I was tempted to pick one of those, since many people haven&#39;t heard it), to their rockin&#39; later stuff. But they really shine when you see them live, and they string together 2 or 3 songs, spending 15, 20, or even 30 minutes playing with the music. And Gordie Johnson can play the guitar like no one else.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Sleep in Late / Big Sugar (500 Pounds)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Monkey Wrench / Foo Fighters (The Colour and the Shape) 3:51
		<p>
			Continuing with the &quot;rock&quot; theme that started the disc, I needed something that kicked things up another notch.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Everlong / Foo Fighters (The Colour and the Shape)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		In The Land Of The Super Freaks / Hammerheads 4:44
		<p>
			Who the heck are The Hammerheads?! They&#39;re a local Ottawa band that plays all the time. You can probably classify them as &quot;disco funk revival&quot; if you had to pick a label. Always a good time out at the bar, and very danceable. Still very high energy like the previous two songs, but without that hard rock edge.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> I wanted a band that few if any had heard, so an alternate would likely have been something from another Ottawa band, Andrew Vincent and the Pirates.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Exploration / Thievery Corporation-DJ Kicks 3:07
		<p>
			Bringing the energy and speed down a notch. Retro vocal samples plus a blend of instruments and beats. The alternate was too long and a little too electronic after the preceding songs.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Escape to Neptune / Rising High Trance Injection</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Burn One Down / Ben Harper (Fight For Your Mind) 3:31
		<p>
			I&#39;ve only seen Ben Harper live once, and that&#39;s not nearly enough times. How does one go about picking a favourite song? The music is great, the lyrics are great, and there are a ton to choose from.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Excuse Me Mister (live) / Ben Harper (Live from Mars 1)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Candela / Buena Vista Social Club 5:31
		<p>
			This was a case of me wanting to put something &quot;different&quot; in to switch the mood a little. I like Spanish / Cuban music, and this BVSC has a great little melody in the background that weaves in and out of the vocal track.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Cracklin&#39; Rosie / Neil Diamond (His 12 Greatest Hits) 2:59
		<p>
			What? You don&#39;t like Neil Diamond?! Of course you do, you just have to listen to him a couple more times. Bet you weren&#39;t expecting that on here. Neil, for all his cheese, puts together some fun, listenable music.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Kentucky Woman / Neil Diamond</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Woman Of The Ghetto / Hortense Ellis (Impact!) 3:05
		<p>
			I like the vocals on this particular track. The compilation is by <a href="http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/impact.htm" title="Impact! by Soul Jazz Records">Soul Jazz Records</a>, and is a British import. A great restaurant in Ottawa called the Black Tomato has great music like this, and they&#39;ll even sell it to you.</p>
		<p>
			Alternate pick: Be Thankful / Donovan Carless (Impact)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Holes To Heaven / Jack Johnson (On and On)) 2:55
		<p>
			&quot;There were so many fewer questions / when stars were still just the holes to heaven&quot; -- what a great lyric. The bass lines in this have great hooks (are you beginning to see I like background beats?).</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Bubble Toes / Jack Johnson (Brushfire Fairytales)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Wrong / Everything But The Girl (Walking Wounded) 4:38
		<p>
			Kicking off a three song electronica run, there are enough vocals in this to make a good transition from Jack. I love every song on this album, and it&#39;s one I often include on &quot;Intro to House&quot; mixes.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Corcovado / Everything But The Girl (Walking Wounded) a.k.a. the &quot;32 flavours and then some&quot; song.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Part of The Process / Morcheeba (Big Calm) 4:27
		<p>
			I had a choice of putting in some old Morcheeba, or some new Morcheeba, and I chose old. The new Charango album took me some time to get used to, but now I really like it.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Charango (feat. Pace Won) / Morcheeba (Charango)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Hymn Of The Big Wheel / Massive Attack (Blue Lines) 6:37
		<p>
			By this third track, I&#39;ve got you right where I want you: nice and relaxed, with your ears perked up to suck in some more beats and interesting voices. I went with old instead of new again.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Karmacoma / Massive Attack (Protection)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Dobie - I Miss You (Sunshine Mix) / Bjork (Telegram) 5:35
		<p>
			Bjork&#39;s strange voice should start to get you out of relaxation mode, but in not too jarring of a way. I like this mixed version of the song.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Here&#39;s That Rainy Day (Koop Remix) / Astrud Gilberto (Verve Remixed 2) 3:31
		<p>
			The beginning of this song almost has a little Super Mario Bros. vibe to it. This is from the <a href="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/product.aspx?ob=n&amp;src=art&amp;pid=10832">Verve Remixed 2</a> double album. One CD is filled with jazz originals, the second contains remixed versions of the originals.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Altnerate pick:</i> Fried Neckbones and Some Homefries (Dan the Automator Remix) / Willie Bobo (Verve Remixed 2) -- because of the name of the song, of course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Thick Necked Man / Crash Test Dummies (The Ghosts that Haunt Me) 3:20
		<p>
			And now for something completely different! Listen to the lyrics or just kind of tap your feet and get the music.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> The Superman Song / Crash Test Dummies (The Ghosts thaat Haunt Me)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Psycho Killer (Live) / Talking Heads (Stop Making Sense) 4:24
		<p>
			I wanted to round out the disc with a live track, and this song is a classic that was nicely different from the rest of the music.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Alternate pick:</i> Burning Down the House / Talking Heads (Stop Making Sense)</p>
	</li>

	Of course, I wasn&#39;t quite organized enough to manage printing a cool insert ahead of time, so I&#39;ve gone the techie route. There are three PDFs to choose from to download and print:</p>
