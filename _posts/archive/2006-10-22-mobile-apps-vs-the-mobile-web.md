<p>I made this post originally with <a href="http://www.blogplanet.net">Blogplanet</a>, a Java app for mobile. It may end up being one of the few mobile apps that I actually keep around.</p>  <p>But what do I mean about mobile apps vs. the mobile web? Well, we talk a lot about web applications, but we usually think about a full desktop and browser supporting them. The mobile web can be thought of as being the web optimized for mobile devices, or we can think about how web-based applications should be evolving to work well with mobile devices.</p><p>Then there are mobile apps. Many of them are, indeed, written in Java for that mythical write once run anywhere, although in the mobile world it&#39;s more like write once, endlessly test, tweak, and optimize everywhere. The platform specific apps tend to be richer and more polished -- e.g. Series 60 apps for the vast variety of Symbian phones out there. ShoZu is a pretty good example, but even there, there is Seres 60 vXX where incompatibilities creep in.</p><p>So, I&#39;ve been using both the mobile web and mobile apps on my new E61. And the mobile web is winning. Much of that is due to Google.</p><p>Gmail? Works great in HTML (*not* mobile) mode using the built in browser. Google Reader has a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/m">mobile friendly mode</a>. Google Maps actually doesn&#39;t work very well / at all, and I actually used Mapquest. But, then there&#39;s a mobile app for this -- downloadable <a href="http://www.google.com/gmm/index.html">Google Maps for Mobile</a>. Chalk one point up for mobile apps.</p><p>So why would I use Gmail instead of the built in email client? Which I could even configure with Blackberry push email? Well, one reason is that Gmail for domains is my main email, and I heavily label / sort my email. On the mobile, using POP3, it just grabs everything.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see myself using the built in email client until Gmail (or another system I use) supports IMAP.</p><p>Going forward, the browser on my mobile device will, like the desktop, continue to be the most important application on there. Are you developing for mobile? Well, forget it...you&#39;re developing for the web, some of it just happens to have slightly smaller screens. <br /></p>
