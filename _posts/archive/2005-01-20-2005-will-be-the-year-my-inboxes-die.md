<p>An in-depth, full-bore write up of spam, email, IM, and the arms-race in dealing with it all.</p>

<p>And a prediction that people want...or <strong>need</strong>...to move on to some other communications medium that doesn't suffer so badly:</p>

<blockquote>
You can only slice the 'time pie' so thin before the wedge just crumbles and you have no choice but to move on... Which means IM services better step up and start to kick ass this year, as I am starting to believe 2005 will be the year my inboxes die.

</blockquote>

<p>Other quotes, like "It's actually affecting <em>tuition</em> costs at some Universities", simply can't be ignored.</p>

<p>Get in touch with me by mentioning me in a blog post? That works. Would do attachments nicely, too.</p>
