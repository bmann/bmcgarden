<p>Sorry, Alex, I don't use <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com">Quicksilver</a>. Lots of people do (by my count, maybe 50% or more of power users, as modeled by my colleagues). I'm sticking with Tiger's built in Spotlight capability. It's slower than Quicksilver, but it's built right into everything.</p>

<p>And yes, not being able to add items/tasks/people to more than one category in OD4Contact *is* frustrating. I'm using project-based organization, since it is supposed to be mainly for task tracking, and this seems to work OK.</p>
