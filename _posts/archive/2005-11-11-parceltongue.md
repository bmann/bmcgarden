<p><em>Do <strong>you</strong> speak snake? A Jabber server written on the Python Twisted framework.</em></p><p>This is a new project of mine/Bryght&#39;s. I&#39;ve long been an advocate for the Jabber/XMPP protocol. Now, I&#39;m hoping to give something back plus form a community around a new jabber server daemon. For now, just redirects to a wiki where we&#39;ll organize and add some more details. Feel free to add &quot;like to have&quot; or other ideas of what you want to see out of a new Python-based jabberd.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> we changed the name to Pretzel. There is currently a placeholder project up at Google Code Hosting: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pretzel/">Pretzel Server&nbsp;</a></p>
