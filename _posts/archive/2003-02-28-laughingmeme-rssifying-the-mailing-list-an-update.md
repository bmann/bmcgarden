Now this is a good idea, and another good example of intertwingling:
<blockquote>Dan Brickley just mentioned a patch to Mailman for producing RSS feeds for a list.</blockquote>Check out <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000450.html">this blurb</a>, as well as the other interesting items that LaughingMeme has to offer (including the much longer, <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/000234.html">original post about this</a>, back in Nov. '02).

RSS, RSS aggregators -- these seem to be turning into <em>the</em> common format for pushing/mixing data all over the web. With blogs, increasingly, being on the "input" side of the stream.
