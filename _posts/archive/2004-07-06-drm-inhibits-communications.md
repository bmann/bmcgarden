<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, telecom is about communications, not media. DRM inhibits communications. That&#8217;s the opposite of what you&#8217;re after. If we&#8217;d had DRM before the Internet became widely available, telcos would have sold a lot less dial-up and broadband, and the industry would have even more unlit fiber than it does today.</p>
<p>How many future broadband and FTTH sales will be lost because you can&#8217;t share a few moments of a good TV show with your granny over the Internet?</p>
