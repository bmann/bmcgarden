I first got wind of this from <strong>Andy</strong>, who's just reaching his 1 year anniversary as a Mac user:
<blockquote>Hmmm... new on-line music service from the mother ship?

<a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5311076.htm">http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5311076.htm</a></blockquote>The Register also <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/29577.html">has the story</a>, and basically figures that if Apple doesn't build their own system, that Mac users will be screwed, since most existing online music purchase systems require Windows.

I think that if Apple does a good job, and actually sells, that they will once again drag along the rest of the industry.
