<p>No, really, we want people talking. <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/" target="_self" title="Canadian Blogging Conference">Northern Voice 2006</a> is pretty much right around the corner. The official deadline is <strike>tomorrow</strike>* next week, Wednesday, Nov. 16th. So <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission" target="_self">apply as a speaker</a>. Remember, this is a very &quot;open tent&quot;, not necessarily &uuml;ber techie conference. Come and share stories with us in Vancouver. It's going to be the same shareable size -- about 250 people give or take, except that day 1 is <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/wiki/moose-camp" target="_self">Moose Camp</a> -- an open day for special interest groups or just old friends to take over the space. This is not a complete unconference -- maybe you want to organize a mini conference of 10 or 20 people that are all interested in the same subject. Head over to the <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/wiki" target="_self">wiki</a> and self organize (and let us know, and we'll help make sure the word gets out).</p><p>I may actually extend this conference and try and gather people together for the week preceding Moose Camp/Northern Voice -- a gathering of open source CMS/Blogging tools to talk about cross platform issues and working more closely together on standards and interoperability. Watch this space for more info (think Vancouver/Whistler in February: how could you NOT want to come?). At the very least, there will likely be a DrupalCon Vancouver 2006. Moose Camp will be the culmination of this event, hopefully as fun as the BarCamp Amsterdam event I attended at Mediamatic. What can I say, I might just be addicted to these things...<br /> </p><p>(Yes, <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/" target="_self">Julie</a>, that does mean you -- don't even think about NOT submitting something! or maybe <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog" target="_self">Ted</a> wants to try something a little less like his usual techie stuff?)</p><p>So, any EduBloggers? Knitting Bloggers? Food Bloggers? From journalists to home makers to gardeners to people just telling stories, we want speakers that have things to share. It's a wide audience, from lots of local Vancouverites wanting to find out more to lots of top bloggers and techies from around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>*Just me living in the future again, I guess <img border="0" src="/hm/profiles/standard/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif" /><br /> </p>
