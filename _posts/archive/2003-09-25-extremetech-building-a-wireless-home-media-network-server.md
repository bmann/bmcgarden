The <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2003/09/building_a_wire.html">PVRBlog</a> pointed to <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1276366,00.asp">Extremetech's article</a>:
<blockquote>They picked SnapStream as their PVR software after reaching many of the same conclusions I did. In the end, the systems come to around $1400, but if you are using parts from old computers, it's possible to cut that down quite a bit.</blockquote>
Ouch..the pricing is a bit high, but they really do throw everything in.<!--break--> Check the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1276435,00.asp">parts list</a>. Mine would be a little different (mainly dropping stuff you don't need, like monitor, keyboard, etc. etc. -- that's what VNC or Remote Desktop are for; this is a server, after all):
<ul>
<li><strong>Case/Motherboard:</strong> Shuttle $320</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel P4 2.8Ghz $175</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> ATI All-in-Wonder R9000 $130</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512MB $90</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 120GB $100</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Audigy $55</li><li><strong>Optical:</strong> DVD-CD/RW $40</li><li><strong>PVR Software:</strong> Snapstream $80</li></ul>
<strong>Total:</strong> $990USD

You could go even cheaper by using a less expensive case and processor combo -- like a $50 case, $100 motherboard, and $100 processor...bringing the price down to $745USD. Oh, right -- this also doesn't include the cost of Windows. OEM price on WinXP is around $150 or more. Ouch.
