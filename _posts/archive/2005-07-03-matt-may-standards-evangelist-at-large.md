<p>Down at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a>, I got to spend a little bit of time chatting with <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/">Matt May</a>. He just <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/archive/date/2005/06/click-ok-to-confirm/">hit OK</a> on the last days of his "real" job with the W3C.</p>

<p>We spent some time comparing notes on not knowing where the next paycheque is coming from exactly, the difficulty that significant-non-blogging-others have wrapping their minds around the whole concept of "people on the Internet know me", and the general exhilaration of doing your own thing.</p>

<p>So, you can feel free to try and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/hire-matt-may">hire Matt May</a>, but it sounds like he's got some interesting projects of his own to work on.</p>

<p>Good luck, Matt, I'm sure you'll do fine. P.S. You'll want to update your "about me" section :P</p>
