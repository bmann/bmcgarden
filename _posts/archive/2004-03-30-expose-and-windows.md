I use OS X on a TiBook as my primary machine.  When I review software, however, I frequently use Windows.  Today, while on a Windows machine I was frantically moving the mouse into the lower left-hand corner to expose my running windows so I could find the one I wanted.  Didn't work.  :-)  That's when you know a feature has taken hold of you. <cite><a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/03/30.html#a1138">Windley's Enterprise Computing Weblog: Expose and Windows</a></cite>
