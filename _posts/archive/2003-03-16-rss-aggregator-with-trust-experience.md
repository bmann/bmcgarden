	OK, the title is a bit contrived, just so I could get a cool acronym (<strong>RATE</strong> -- it will all make sense in a minute). So, I just added a particular blog/site to my &quot;daily news&quot;. What about Phil? Or Greg? Or Graham? etc. etc. All these people that are somewhat interested in the same thing should be able to be fed news that their friends are also interested in/found interesting.OK, the title is a bit contrived, just so I could get a cool acronym (<strong>RATE</strong> -- it will all make sense in a minute). I was reading <a href="http://w-uh.com/">Critical Section</a> after surfing my referrer logs (does <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> have TrackBack? I don&#39;t know...) and added their RSS feed to my daily list. I could add them to the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=import&amp;op=feeds">feeds here</a>, and I should probably get in the habit of doing that -- makes it easier to link to, rather than cutting and pasting a bunch of URLs.

But maybe this doesn&#39;t need another mechanism. Perhaps the intertwingling of blogs, trackbacks, comments, etc. are already creating it naturally. And perhaps this is what Google is going to try and surf, to try and using human experience to do this RATE with, so that people <em>outside</em> the trust web can use the collective experience of people to find information. Wow. I think I just blew my own brain. Too much coffee.</p>
