<p>I held off on posting this for a while, mainly because I was thinking of ways to say more about it. Then, when great people like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/03/OleOnLonghorn">Tim Bray</a> just say "Go read it", I figure I can pretty much do the same.

<blockquote>
If you're still reading and haven't clicked your back button in disgust, let me explain.  <strong>The most important thing is not how easy it is to build code, the most important thing is how well the code runs once it is built.</strong>  This concept seems to have escaped the Longhorn developers, and from this viewpoint Longhorn and its underlying technologies are pretty unexciting.

Ole's post is called <a href="http://w-uh.com/index.cgi/articles/031102-emperors_new_code.html">The Emperor's New Code</a> -- he figures for the most part that a lot of stuff that Microsoft announced is re-inventing the wheel. A chance to throw in whiz-bang without having to address any current problems.
