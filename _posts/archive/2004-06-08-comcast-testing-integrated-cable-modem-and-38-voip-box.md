<blockquote>
<p>Comcast is testing a new combined cable modem and VoIP adapter in a few cities, according to Light Reading.</p>

<p>I'm also hearing reports that D-Link will release a line of in home networking equipment at SuperComm in a few weeks that includes a wireless adapter that has built in VoIP.</p></blockquote>

<p>D-Link makes the voice gateway that Primus' Talkbroadband uses. I did work 3 years ago looking at the different ways to distribute connectivity throughout a house. I concluded the only way to do it was wirelessly*, but wireless was still too expensive and too slow at the time. Devices like <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1217">Apple's AirportExpress</a> show that wireless innovation is taking off again.</p>

<p>Hmmm...imagine a USB telephone handset plugged into the AirportExpress...</p>

<p>*Well, the other option was using the ubiquitous coax cabling that houses already have installed, but that required development of a IP-over-Coax. It hasn't been developed since then, so wireless it is. </p>
