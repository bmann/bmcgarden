<p>The <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> guys are planning world domination with us here at <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a>. <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/2005/10/21/barcamp_2">Ralph</a> is keeping the secret pretty close to his chest, but we've got it pretty well sketched out: our session is at 14:30 today in the kitchen</p>  <p>Apparently, <a title="Best PHP CMS that uses PostgreSQL" href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> isn't ranking highly in searches for &quot;PHP CMS&quot;, so I'm doing some links to help with that. Funny thing is, searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=broken+CMS">Broken CMS</a> ends up pointing to a Drupal-powered site...but it has links to Typo3, XOOPS, and PHPWCMS. Yeah, we laughed.</p>  <p>I'm hoping that <a href="http://walkah.net">James</a> will commit his <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jabber">Jabber module</a> today, so that we can kick the tires on it. Of course, the <a href="http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/">ejabberd server</a> already runs their community site on Drupal. We had a little bit of a discussion about have a new jabberd server that has some of the attributes of ejabberd -- distributed, fault-tolerant, etc. -- except, not written in a not very widely supported language like erlang. Python and the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted networking framework</a> sound like good choices.</p>
