<p><a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com" title="The Blogfather of Vancouver">Darren</a> is leading a great discussion on how <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/001202.html">PR isn't actually dead after all</a>.</p>

<p>Darren is a good person to be having this discussion with. His personal blog is very popular, and his day job is running a <a title="Capulet Communications - Vancouver" href="http://www.capulet.com">firm</a> that provides (among other things) marketing and communications. And yes, it's highly likely we'll eventually pay him to do something with <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a>.</p>
