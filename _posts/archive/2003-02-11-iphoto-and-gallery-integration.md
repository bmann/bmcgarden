As I've <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node.php?id=23">said elsewhere</a>, <a href="http://gallery.sf.net">Gallery</a> is still the best web-based photo gallery app.

Now I'd like to shortcut my two-step process of using <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> plus <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpWiki&file=index&pagename=Gallery%20Remote">Gallery Remote</a> (make sure you add the <a href="http://jpmullan.com/galleryupdates/">beta stuff</a> if you want everything working nicely).
<!--break-->
Ideally, the <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org">LazyWeb</a> will conjure up someone who knows the inner workings of iPhoto and can make a plug-in that adds a "Gallery" tab to the Export function. Select photos, choose whether to resize locally, connect to your Gallery and select/create an album, press export -- voila!

The new(est) versions of Gallery allow for WinXP users to install a DLL/registry hack that adds their Gallery as an option for the "publish to web" button that appears in folders filled with images, so I know it's doable. The <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync.html">Missing Sync</a> even adds an Export tab to get iPhoto pics into my Sony Clie!

<strong>Update Aug. 28, 2003:</strong> An <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iPhotoToGallery</a> exporter <a href="/node/view/533">now exists</a>.
