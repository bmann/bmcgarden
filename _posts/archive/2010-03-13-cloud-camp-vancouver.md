	I&#39;m at <a href="http://cloudcamp.org/vancouver">Cloud Camp Vancouver</a> today. It&#39;s at the <a href="http://www.discoveryparks.com/listings/dpv_overview.php">Discovery Parks Vancouver</a> venue where we had <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2009">Barcamp Vancouver 2009</a>. The Twitter hashtag is <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23cloudcamp+%23vancouver">#cloudcamp #vancouver</a>. I&#39;ll be doing updates throughout the day.</p>

<p>
	Cool, <a href="http://twitter.com/akalsey">Adam Kalsey</a> flew up from Sacramento to attend (he&#39;s with <a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a> now). First time I&#39;ve met him in person, been following his <a href="http://kalsey.com/">blog</a> for many many years.</p>
<p>
	Questions from <a href="http://twitter.com/troyangrignon">Troy</a> to kick off the day: How many are business oriented? 1/3&nbsp;How many are technical oriented? 2/3</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://twitter.com/davenielsen">Dave Nielsen</a>, CloudCamp founder, kicking off the day, talking about unconferences, Open Space concept, etc. Only about 1/3 of people have attended an &quot;unconference&quot; before.</p>
<p>
	Troy kicking things off with a <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a> lightning talk. <a href="http://animoto.com/">Animoto</a> launched on Facebook using RightScale scaling: &quot;try and run around provisioning 4700 physical servers in 2 days&quot; - no way to do it without cloud.</p>
<p>
	Took part in an expert panel to kick off the day. I talked about the question of what companies are doing &quot;cloud&quot; in Vancouver. I ended up putting up a wiki page - <a href="http://barcamp.org/VancouverCloudProjects">Vancouver Cloud Projects</a>. Please add your own links to companies.</p>
