<blockquote>
<p>For the music industry, <acronym title="Light Weight Digital Rights Management">LWDRM</acronym> means that its copyrights can still be violated when consumers bypass the digital certificate. However, adoption of the system could be a PR victory for an industry that suffers not only from piracy, but also from a lack of goodwill from most consumers.</p>

<p>This idea is from the <a href="http://www.fraunhofer.de/english/">Fraunhofer Institute</a>, the same people that originally invented MP3. They actually developed the technology for MPEG4, but are essentially back-porting it to be used with MP3. It looks like it's a ways from actually being implemented, and somehow I think that this is just one more attempt to put the genie back in the bottle.</p>

<p>Fraunhofer also talks about having a full turn-key solution, with micro-payments and an online store for sale along with the technology for anyone that wants to implement it.</p>

It's hard to see much that's new in this proposal. If we ignore the newly coined LWDRM buzzword and the accompanying marketing spin, we're left with a fairly standard looking DRM scheme, of the type I call mark-and-trace.
