<p><a href="http://scottstuff.net">Scott Laird</a> is now <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlaird/">on Flickr</a>. As he mentions below, we've been tracking each others stuff for some time now, and he found the infamous beer tower picture that is on the 1001 home page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weird example &#8211; 1001&rsquo;s <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">home page</a> has a few example pictures, and the last one looked kind of familiar to me.  I haven&rsquo;t seen the picture before, but the guy on the left looks a lot like <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris Mann</a>; Boris and I have been swapping comments on each other&rsquo;s blogs for quite a while now.  A bit of searching and I found the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkah/1085837/">original</a> picture of Boris and <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland Tangelo</a>.  Even though I&rsquo;ve never actually <em>met</em> Boris, I&rsquo;ve met at least three or four of the people on his Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/boris/contacts/">contacts list</a> and I read the blogs of several others.  I picked a few other people on his contact list and looked at <em>their</em> contact lists, and I kept finding more people I knew.  I&rsquo;m not sure if this is all that <em>useful</em>, but it&rsquo;s certainly interesting, and it&rsquo;s given me a chance to see a lot of fascinating pictures.</p>

<p>Useful? Well, it's one more place where people can connect directly and get a better sense of each other's lives, interests, and pass times. All of which are good things, I think.</p>

<p>And one of these days when I am down in Seattle I'm going to meet Scott.</p>
