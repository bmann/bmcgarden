<p><a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1477">Video support in iTunes: check</a>. Now off to find some video to buy.</p>

<p>Well, not really -- it happened by accident. I was browsing around and noticed that the Canadian iTMS had something new from Gorillaz featured.</p>

<p>Turns out that Feel Good Inc (Single Edit) is an album...because it comes bundled with the music videos for four other songs: Game of Death, Hey Our Toys, Jump Gut, and Tibet. In the interests of research (well, and it's a pretty good song), I paid my 99 cents to buy the &quot;album&quot;.</p>

<p>You can check it out yourself using the iTunes link below (Canadian storefront) or read on for my description.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=1065">AppleInsider</a> talks about premium video content that you pay for directly, as opposed to the bundled freebies that I bought.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>The videos are each listed as &quot;Video -&quot; followed by the name of the song, and have a little movie camera icon next to them. There is no preview, and the time is listed as 0:00, with the album being the same as the single.</p>

<p>Once downloaded, I figured out that these particular videos aren't actually music videos: they are little animated Gorillaz shorts. I didn't pay any extra for them since they were &quot;bundled&quot; with the song, so that's OK, but Apple will have to do previews, which currently don't work.</p>

<p>The downloaded files are MPEG 4 Video at 30fps, with an AAC, stereo, 48Khz audio track. The video's base resolution is 480x272. Weird...sounds like the dimensions for a small screen...</p>

<p>Even fullscreen, the videos look quite good. Size-wise, the longest video (1 minute, 20sec) was 15.7MB in size, or about 10MB per minute.</p><p>Doing a search for &quot;video&quot; in the iTMS doesn't pick up any of these files, so it looks like this is a bit of a stealth rollout.</p>
