	I had recently installed <a href="http://www.zankasoftware.com/wired/">Wired</a>, which installs a Hotline-like server. There is no uninstaller and it puts junk in a bunch of different places. The easiest way to uninstall applications which use the <code>.pkg</code> format is to to use the OSX Package Manager. Find out more at <a href="http://www.osxgnu.org/">OSX GNU.org</a>. You can download the OSX Package Manager directly: <a href="ftp://us.osxgnu.org/pub/osxgnu/OSXPM/OSXPackageManager.sit">OSXPackageManager.sit</a></p>
