<p>I'm back from Boston. Oh? Yeah, I didn't really mention that. I did end up doing a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/5270">geek meetup</a>, of course. Was a small group, but fun as usual. Summary: there is lots of exciting stuff in Drupal's future, there is too much to do today, there are some fun ideas and activities going to happen at the <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org">Barcelona Drupalcon</a>.</p>

<p>Spent some great time with <a href="http://www.cadence90.com/">Lisa Williams</a> of <a href="http://www.placeblogger.com">Placeblogger</a> and <a href="http://h2otown.info/" title="Aggregator of all things Watertown, outside of Boston">h20town</a> fame. I got to not only see the famous Watertown part of Boston, but even ate there, at a place called <a href="http://lacasadepedro.com/">La Casa de Pedro</a>. Turns out Lisa is my kind of restaurant eater: lots of meat! I had a flank steak on top of two different kinds of chorizo. Yes, three meats. Thanks again, Lisa, looking forward to more Placeblogger adventures...</p>

<p>Why was I in Boston? The folks at <a href="http://crameronline.com/">Cramer</a> are doing a Drupal build for a large client, and I'm helping architect. The best part about the Cramer offices is the coffee. They have these crazy little foil-topped plastic containers with coffee in them -- different blends, like West Coast and so on -- and you insert the container directly into the machine, foil top and all, stick a cup underneath, and press brew. Somehow, the magical machine punctures the foil, spits the coffee into the cup, and devours the container. Very cool, and wicked pissah coffee, too (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent" title="Wikipedia page on the Boston accent -- wicked pissah means good">ref</a>).</p>

<p>I didn't see much else of Boston except for the two trips above I mentioned, but did do a bit of driving around various highways. Yes, that is about as exciting as it sounds. Next time I have to eat some 'chowda' ("say it, Frenchie!").</p>

<p>Hmmm. This is the "personal" section. I suppose it should be less geeky, but then, that always happens to me. There are many other things going on, and I am working on looking forward. I'm heading to Ottawa at the end of August and will reconnect with many old friends, I might take some time and hike California with my good friend <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/">Jon</a>, and... who knows. There isn't much else I feel like sharing at this point. I've been doing some journaling privately (<a href="http://bmann.livejournal.com">here</a> -- I might eventually post some friends only stuff, but don't hold your breath).</p>
