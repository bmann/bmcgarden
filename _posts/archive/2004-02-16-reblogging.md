<p>
	Using MovableType hacks, <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/reblog/">Eyebeam created reBlogging</a>.</p>
<p>
	Except, of course, that <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> has always been able to do that: classify feeds with different keywords automatically, and then individually tag them with different keywords if desired.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re logged into this site, all the external feeds (two on the front page -- Friends and Interesting, plus of course <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/sources">all the other feeds</a>) have little &quot;blog it&quot; links next to them. I can select a set of taxonomy terms, re-title it, and just publish it straight up.<!--break-->Actually, the <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/import">import contributed module</a> goes one step further.</p>
<p>
	Imported feeds are actually first-class nodes, essentially indistinguishable from regular postings. And they can also be tagged with taxonomy terms automatically, in order to set up custom re-feeds.</p>
<p>
	Copyright? Right-of-first syndication?</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s turtles all the way down, I suppose.</p>
