<p>Well, we're almost 5 hours past Leap Day -- Feb 29th. I hope everyone celebrated in a manner appropriate to their nationality. I was talking with friends about various schemes to design Canadian Leap Day traditions, and all we settled on was that it should probably involve bacon in some way.</p>

<p>I made it through Northern Voice (see my <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/northern-voice-2008-wrap" title="2008 Northern Voice wrap up">stream-of-consciousness wrap up</a>) without getting sick, and even had an awesome relaxing day going for brunch and a photowalk on the Sunday afternoon, but Monday morning I succumbed to a sore throat and cold. I'm back in action (sort of) due to the much-Facebooked "crazy German medicine" called <a href="http://www.netdoktor.de/medikamente/100007150.htm">Aspecton</a> (it's sort of like the German equivalent of Buckley's, except no sugar or alcohol -- thanks, Mom!).</p>

<p>So, that's a bit of an update from the recent events. I'm <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/blogs-and-pods/boris-mann/boston-drupalcon-bound">off to Boston for a Drupal event</a> in about 20 minutes, so here are links that I'm behind on:</p>

<ul>
<li>continuing the tradition of giving <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/vancouver-seo-birthday-gift-alex-brabant-emarketing-101">links as birthday gifts</a>, <a href="http://www.emarketing101.net/blog/item/happy-birthday-to-boris-mann-from-boris-mann-consulting/">Vancouver SEO guy Alex Brabant sent some my way</a></li>
<li>I'm <a href="http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008/sessions/6567/details">speaking at the CCI2008 conference</a> March 12th to 14th here in Vancouver -- yes, this needs a longer post</li>
<li>did I mention I have a new startup? this SO needs its own post, but I have purposefully not been promoting it here (and this is still a "Personal" category -- so not on the front page / in the main feed). It's called <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com" title="Startup incubator in Vancouver - helping you quit your day job">Bootup Labs, and it's a Vancouver-based incubator for startups</a> -- my partner is <a href="http://www.strutta.com">Danny Robinson of recent Strutta fame</a>. Missing some of my blogging? Yeah, I'm doing blogging over there as well.</li>
<li>the <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/feeds">borisphere page</a> again contains links to external feeds that I'm aggregating</li>
<li>don't forget about <a href="http://foodlikethat.com">Food Like That</a> -- just added a post about some fine eating in San Fran, and my mom is still busy adding recipes :P</li>
<li>I swear I had more bullet points to add, but I bet that's the cab outside the door to take me to YVR....take care, see you after the 7th....</li>
</ul>
