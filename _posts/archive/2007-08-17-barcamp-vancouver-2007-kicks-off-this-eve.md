<p>Here we are at noon on the eve of <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007">BarCamp Vancouver 2007</a>. <a href="http://www.duanestorey.com">Duane Storey</a> and I are hacking some <a href="http://www.mycallmonster.com">phone VoIP stuff</a>, I'll be doing geo logging (surprise!) and....and I don't know what else will happen.</p>

<p>It was great to read through <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/08/15/barcamp-barcamp-amsterdam-and-barcamp-vancouver-looking-back-and-looking-forward">Roland's retrospective of BarCamp's</a> we've been involved in. I think he missed BarCamp SF at the Microsoft offices...I caught part of that after a late flight in.

<p>BarCamp Amsterdam has to be one of my favourites. <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com">Chris Pirillo</a> came in with a big donation that helped (European) beer-fueled hacking, the Mediamatic people and offices were fantastic, and lots of my European friends were there that I don't get to see very often. Oh, right, and I got to cook for 50+ people over an open flame indoors :P</p>

<p>I love unconferences. I wasn't involved in organizing this year's BarCamp Vancouver, so thanks to the many organizers and helpers. Here's what <a href="http://www.telltenfriends.com/blog/2007/08/14/barcampvancouver2007/">Jordan Behan has to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
After last yearâ€™s event, I was so amazed at the things I learned and the people I met that I wanted to help out anywhere I could this year. So I joined (invited myself onto) the organizing committee, and thus I feel it is my duty to share a bit of Barcamp How-to.
</blockquote>

<p>That's exactly the spirit we want to see. See you tonight...</p>
