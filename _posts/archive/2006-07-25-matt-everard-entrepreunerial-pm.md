<p>I got a ping from Matt Everard, saying that his blog is now &quot;ready&quot;. He calls it <a href="http://entreprenpm.wordpress.com/">Entrepreneurial Project Management</a>.</p>  <p>Who is Matt? He&#39;s a smart, interesting project management and dev type who is trying to move to the beauty that is Vancouver (I mentioned him briefly in my post on <a href="/blog/bmann/vancouver-is-a-fine-place-to-start-a-company-or-to-join-one">Vancouver being a fine place to start or join a company</a>). Here&#39;s a snippet from his about page:</p>  <blockquote> [This site] is a bit of an intellectual dumping ground containing my musings on &ldquo;in the trenches, get it done, IT project management&rdquo; as well as other bright, shiny objects I find along the way.  The PM Depot is a work-in-progress, hopefully growing to 20 or so &ldquo;best of the web&rdquo; resources (mostly templates and articles) </blockquote>  <p>Matt&#39;s anecdote about project management, using <a href="http://entreprenpm.wordpress.com/2006/07/12/adding-features/">drywalling his basement as an example</a>, does a good job of explaining some of the difficulties in working with clients and adding features. There&#39;s more like this from him, that I can tell comes from experience -- so go on over and check out <a href="http://entreprenpm.wordpress.com/">his blog</a>. And if you&#39;re looking for a good technical/dev project manager in Vancouver...hire him!</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Matt got hired by <a href="http://www.atimi.com">Atimi</a>, and also got a fantastic place to live on Granville Island -- see the <a href="http://entreprenpm.wordpress.com/2006/08/04/change-change-change/">Change, Change, Change post</a> on his blog for more info. Congrats!&nbsp;</p>
