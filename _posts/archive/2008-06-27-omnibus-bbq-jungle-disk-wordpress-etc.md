<p>Well, contrary to the lack of posting here, I actually have a ton of stuff tumbling around my head right now. And so, an Omnibus post that covers a couple of different items.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianivarieanna/2615299708/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/2615299708_4561455082_m.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" /></a>

<p>I've been heads down busy and haven't been attending (or organizing!) any social media type events lately. I did get out Wednesday night to attend the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/778517/">Freshbooks / Redwerks BBQ</a>. Look, there's me holding a puppy (photo by Ianiv)! It was a beautiful sunny evening and the <a href="http://redwerks.org">Redwerks</a> rooftop patio is awesome. I ended up manning the grill, my secret ploy to meet everyone (at least, everyone that was hungry). It was nice to meet some new people and catch up with a bunch of regulars.</p>

<p>I'm trying <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com">Jungle Disk</a> for my personal backup. In short, it's a cross platform app that both serves as a kind of iDisk as well as some simple backup operations, except that your data is actually stored on Amazon's S3 service. You pay a one time license for the application (and you can install it on as many computers as you want), and you pay as you go for storage. And can get your files from any machine.</p>

<p>I'm currently backing up my Documents folder to a Backup area, and then I also have a second "bucket" (that's actually Amazon tech talk, but it makes sense) that is a true archive -- I copy old stuff there and delete if off my local disk. I'm still debating whether it's worth it for me to put my entire iTunes collection online -- it would solve being able to get my music from anywhere, and it would cost about $12 / month (for 60GB). Not sure what the calculation is for streaming that music some of the time? And yes, this is like <a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com">MP3 Tunes music locker</a>.</p>

<p>So that's my use, but Jungle Disk *also* launched the <a href="http://jungledisk.com/workgroup/how.aspx">WorkGroup edition</a> -- which is the same thing, but lets multiple users in a company use it from a single Amazon account, with things like their own storage space as well as granular user permissions. So you can have a Finance folder that only senior management can access. And if you don't have senior management, then just think about how great it would be to have a small business shared file system that you can access from any computer, anywhere. That's $2/month per employee, which I think is a good price.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress!</a> I've been mucking about in WordPress core and theme code. Once was with <a href="http://rachaelashe.com">Rachael's site</a>, which I upgraded using the FTP dance. I really hate not having command line access.... The second was for the <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs Blog</a>, which I moved off of WordPress.com so we could add some more plugins and do stuff like have a feed for every category / tag. Except, when I went digging around, it seems that the main feed is the only one that is ever injected into the link rel header. So, here's my feature request if you're interested in the gory details: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7190 -- heck, I might even submit a patch :P</p>

<p>etc. There are so many things that could go in the etc. section. Should I talk about how Roger's iPhone pricing plans in Canada suck? Or about some thoughts on S3 and hosting shared files for the Drupal community? Or how my Raincity -- Bootup Labs transition is going? I've got lots going on, and I'll update here with extended posts on some of these topics. For now, it's summer, next week is Canada Day, and I'm going to spend time hanging out on Bowen with some of my favourite people.</p>

<p>P.S. Thanks to everyone that <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/bmann-boris-evolution-usernames">talked about their usernames</a> -- that's one of the longest comment threads I've had in a while, it was fun!</p>
