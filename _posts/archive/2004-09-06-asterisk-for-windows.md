<p>I <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1281" title="Asterisk on OS X">posted about Asterisk for OS X</a>, now there is Asterisk for Windows...sort of. The <a href="http://www.n2net.com">N2Net</a> site doesn't have any information about this, but the <a href="http://voxilla.com/modules.php?op=modload&#38;name=News&#38;file=article&#38;sid=86">Voxilla posting</a> says that it is a distribution built on top of <a href="http://www.colinux.org/" title="Cooperative Linux">coLinux</a>, a version of Linux that runs in parallel with Windows.</p>

<p>Digium, the major supplier of Asterisk hardware, has a <a href="http://www.digium.com/index.php?menu=astwind">press release</a>, with the distribution being called "AstWind".</p>
