<p>This is my first post of personal content back on this site. I'm really enjoying my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/canon-s1-is">new camera</a> -- with a 10x optical zoom! I got jealous of <a href="http://www.smithdm3.com">Dave's</a> 8x optical...</p><br />

<p>I didn't need it for this picture -- I made potatoes for breakfast, since Matt is visiting (he's competing in the <a href="http://www.canadianultimate.com/cuc/2004/">Canadian Ultimate Championships</a>, which are being held at UBC).</p>
