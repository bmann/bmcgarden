<p>Dave Shea visits the future of advanced CSS design and finds it pleasing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway. The point of all this is that I put together a <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/safari12/">very basic page</a> to serve as my test site's root index. My primary browser is Safari, so I took the opportunity to play with the new <code>text-shadow</code> CSS property. (Hit the thumbnail link if you're not using Safari). Combining this with a bit of <code>opacity</code> (upcoming in CSS3, supported now) a bit of generated content, and some guaranteed, non-standard font choices, I've caught a glimpse of where CSS is going. I like it. A lot.</p>
	<p>No images were harmed in the making of this page, it's all pure CSS effects. Here's to 2011, when we might even be able to use this stuff.</p><cite><a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/04/24/safari_css_e/">mezzoblue</a></cite></blockquote>
