No comments from Lloyd about <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari beta 2</a> which now has tabs (which means he can start using it).

<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3059">Mac Dev Center</a> talks about the tab features, as well as "Privacy Reset", which wipes all the stuff that browsers generally store. Cool. Lots of stuff to tinker with (and <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com">play</a>) when I get back to Ottawa.
