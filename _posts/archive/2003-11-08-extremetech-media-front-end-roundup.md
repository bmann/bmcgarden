<p>ExtremeTech considers the following to be the "must have" features, and that is what they used to evaluate the programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play back stored video (WMV, AVI)</li>
<li>Play back stored music (WMA, MP3, WAV)</li>
<li>Display digital photos</li>
<li>Show and time-shift Live TV</li>
<li>Be programmed to record live TV</li>
</ul>
<p>Read on for links to the four applications tested and some thoughts on this segment.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>It seemed a bit crazy to me that in addition to the programs tested, you also needed to be running Windows XP plus 5 other external applications. They used an ATI Remote Wonder that comes bundled with their graphic card to control the apps (with varying degrees of success).</p>

<p>While there is, as <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/658#1193">Greg mentions</a>, a "gold rush" going on in this segment, I don't think it will take off until there are more fully integrated applications that do everything. In my opinion, Linux is still a much better choice here, because of everything from stability to low-cost. The only thing holding it back is lack of driver support for specialized hardware (like remotes).</p>

<p>The reviewed applications were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://myhtpc.net/" >myHTPC</a>: free!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.snapstream.com/" >SnapStream</a>: looked at <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/539">before</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.showshifter.com/" >ShowShifter</a>: got good marks except for the fact that it uses <a href="http://www.titantv.com/">TitanTV</a> in a browser for its <acronym title="Electronic Programming Guide">EPG</acronym></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sage.tv/" >SageTV</a>: Java-based client/server, but it only supports a very small number of hardware tuner cards</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1376553,00.asp">final thoughts</a> don't really pick one stand-out winner, but I think "free" definitely makes myHTPC the most attractive. Round two is going to look at apps which depend on specific hardware configs.</p>
