Hey folks running Bloggen Sites.  I recently encountered a situation where the admin of a bulletin board identified an anonymous post I had made, sending me a message.

How easy is it to do this?  Is it a simple matter of comparing IP addresses?  So anon to the public, and revealed to the admins, is that what the average site is?
