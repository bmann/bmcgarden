I had a great time and it was good to see so many people out.<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.buffmuthers.com/~hadfield/">Scott Hadfield</a> wins the prize for actually OpenID-enabling his blog in real time (and for his bizarro domain name :P).</p><p>My site here does have delegation headers for my <a href="http://home.bryght.com" title="Bryght OpenID 2 Identity Provider">home.bryght.com</a> account (<a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/19/openid/">Simon Willison has good instructions for the OpenID 1.1 format here</a>), but it won&#39;t work most places until we get our code updated with the OpenID 1.1 backwards compatability.&nbsp;</p><p>I think <a href="http://www.jayandsilentrob.com/">Rob of jayandsilentrob.com</a> wins the prize for most errors/frustration encountered in trying to get his site delegating. I realized as we were all clustered around trying to test delegation with various systems....that there are still very few &quot;large&quot; sites that you can just do login with...besides random blog comments. Definitely more work needed here. Oh, and Rob has an event coming up here in Vancouver for tech types (Rob, looked for it in upcoming and couldn&#39;t find it...post/email and I&#39;ll update this).<br /></p><p>Always good to see <a href="http://stewartclan.ca/blogs/thinkinggeek">Michael Stewart</a> out from far-off Delta. He&#39;s leaving the safe surroundings of BCIT in April, and is looking for &quot;what&#39;s next&quot;. Hire him! He&#39;s passionate about identity and knows his stuff, especially in educational contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>A few more links on the <a href="http://mashpit.pbwiki.com/MashPitOpenidVancouverPhpRoom">wiki</a> -- please update with more pointers and learning.</p><p>Special thanks to Lori and the rest of the <a href="http://www.sxip.com">SXIP</a> team. The Belgian beer was much appreciated :P&nbsp;</p>
