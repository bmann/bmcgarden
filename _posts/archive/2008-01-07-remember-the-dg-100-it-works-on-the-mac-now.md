<p>Remember the DG-100-GPS? That cheap data logger that I&#39;ve been really bad at finding the time to use consistently? <a href="/blog/bmann/want-buy-gps-logging-device#comment-136704">Jaako left a comment</a> letting me know that he got the DG-100 working on the Mac:</p><blockquote><p>Hey Boris! Wanted to drop you a line and let you know that I managed to get a pretty decent solution to the DG-100 / Mac issue. The key lies in Mirko Parthey&#39;s dg100.c script he wrote as a basis for implementation into GPSBabel. I <a href="http://www.blog-shmog.com/2008/01/05/globalsat-dg-100-works-on-a-mac" target="_blank" title=" Globalsat DG-100 works on a mac">made some tweaks</a> to his original code and added a GPX output mode and have a pretty reliable command line interface for the DG-100. Check it out ( + the relaunch of my blog ) at <a href="http://www.blog-shmog.com/2008/01/05/globalsat-dg-100-works-on-a-mac" target="_blank" title=" Globalsat DG-100 works on a mac">Blog-Shmog.com</a> and let me know if you have any luck!</p></blockquote><p>I know that <a href="http://justagwailo.com/2008/01/03/dg-100-mac">Richard already followed his instructions and got it working</a> as well. Richard has been doing a great job of geo tagging his photos. Check out his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sillygwailo/map/">map on Flickr</a>. Oh, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/places/">Flickr&#39;s Places</a> feature is AMazing. And the only way to get your pictures in Places is to either geotag them up front, or use the map feature to place them. &quot;Manually&quot; placing can be done in bulk and the interface is quite friendly, so even if you don&#39;t have a GPS device you can easily geotag on Flickr.</p><p>Now I have to listen to my own &quot;call to arms&quot; and do more geotagging myself. I should go poke the LoadMyTracks guys again...it would be great if they could adapt this DG100 script so it &quot;just works&quot; rather than all the compiling and C-editing...Â </p>
