<p>I'm cleaning up and archiving lots of things. Here's a little Drupal-related snippet of text I found in an archived hard disk, from October 2005.</p>
<blockquote> There certainly are a few assigned positions: Dries is benevolent dictator for life, Charlie Lowe is the documentation czar, Chris Messina is an &quot;official&quot; evangelist and Grand High Usability Poo-Bah, I consider myself an official evangelist, and Steve Peck is the closest thing we have to head of support and top forum troll tamer. </blockquote>
<p>Times have changedâ€¦</p>
<p>I also went through and removed myself as member / group admin from a lot of the groups on http://groups.drupal.org. I still wish there was a &quot;mark all as read&quot; function on the site.</p>
<p>I'm looking to only be involved in those areas where I am truly interested, and/or truly effective.</p>
