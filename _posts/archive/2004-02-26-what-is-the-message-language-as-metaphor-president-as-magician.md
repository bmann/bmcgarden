[image:928,right,5,5]<p>From <a href="http://www.mcluhan.utoronto.ca/blogger/2004_02_01_blogarchive.html#107760076746603764">What is the Message?</a>, a pointer to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/20/business/20jobs.html?ex=1077944400&en=41a6b41847c4733a&ei=5062&partner=GOOGLE">NY Times article</a> on how fast food restaurants should be reclassified as part of the manufacturing sector.</p>

<blockquote>
Apparently, according to all the President's men, "assembling the inputs" of the parts of a hamburger into a final product is close enough to assembling an automobile on an assembly line, and thus should be classifed as a manufacturing, as opposed to service sector job. The fact that such a reclassification would do wonders for the nominal job creation statistics in an election year is, well, magical! Abracadabra! Presto chango! Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!
