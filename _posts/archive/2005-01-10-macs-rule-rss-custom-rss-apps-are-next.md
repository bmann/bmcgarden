<p><a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> has an interesting post about <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/000961.html">RSS Market Share</a>. Specifically, what aggregators are being used to read RSS feeds.</p>

<p>Read on for some ideas about the rankings, and where RSS aggregators are going.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The interesting part comes in the top contenders. The web-based <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> is #1 by a long shot. This is, I believe, because of two factors. The first is the &quot;no install&quot; factor. Why not setup a Bloglines account? Just go to a website, register, start reading feeds. And access your news from work, home, or anywhere with a browser. No installing, no selecting an app, no paying or demo apps.</p>

<p>This goes nicely with my ideas around <acronym title="Rich Internet Apps">RIAs</acronym>. Actually, Bloglines isn't very &quot;rich&quot; (yet!), but it is a well-put together web app.</p>

<p>The second factor is what I'll call the &quot;newbie factor&quot;. Any sort of guide to blogging/RSS reading typically includes a link to both Bloglines and MyYahoo as two easy ways to start reading feeds. And because of the no-install factor, lots of people do create accounts. Heck, I still have an account -- so those numbers might be skewed the same way &quot;abandoned&quot; blogs are: how many of those subscriptions are for active accounts? A &quot;What if someone subscribes to your feed but doesn't read it?&quot; sort of thing.</p>

<p>The second highest aggregator (although half that of Bloglines -- 32% vs. 16%), is <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>. A Mac-only app. Let me say it again: Mac only. So that means that of all of the people aggregating RSS feeds, a heck of a lot of them are using Macs.</p>

<p>I have a couple of theories here. First is lack of insanely great news aggregator for Windows. NewsGator seems well-liked, and probably fits well in the using-at-work crowd. But there are lots of people that don't like to treat RSS like email, and also lots that don't like Outlook. FeedDemon has been recommended to me as a good option, but it is for-pay only (NNW has a &quot;Light&quot; sibling that is free).</p>

<p>So, is great news aggregation software driving people to the Mac platform? I wouldn't stretch that far.</p>

<p>I guess my second theory must be true: of the power Internet users that use RSS, many of them (a majority?) use Macs. This also suggests to me we're not even close to seeing mass market adoption of RSS. I mean, I knew that, but these numbers seem to clearly indicate that.</p>

<p>What happens when the masses arrive? Well, I happen to think that the masses aren't interested in news aggregation. They don't want to drink from a firehose of 100, 200, or (<a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a>, <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a>) 1000 feeds. They want news they're interested in (topics + filters) and they want to be kept up to date with &quot;stuff&quot; (i.e. notified - searches, PubSub, etc.).</p>

<p>This will in part be satisfied by portals. Only Yahoo fits here -- Bloglines needs to get less aggregator-y and more custom-web-page-y; yes, kind of like <a href="http://www.kinja.com">Kinja</a>, but with (still) less focus on this thing called a &quot;weblog&quot; and more of a focus on stuff-I-want-to-know.</p> 

<p>The other half of this &quot;stuff comes to me&quot; will be handled by desktop apps. But not general news aggregators (although some of them might evolve to do more than one thing). You'll have your music app thingie -- powered by RSS (think audioscrobbler, last.fm, and, heck, &quot;podcasts&quot; directly into iTunes of new music). You'll have your photo thingie (it's here, it's called <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a>). And your average end user won't know or care that RSS is a standard for pushing content around the Internet.</p>

<p>What else? Well, <a href="http://marc.blogs.it">Marc's</a> OpenListings will want a dedicated classifieds app. Well, maybe more than one -- one for buying and selling general stuff (like your newspaper or craig's list) and perhaps another, fancier one for looking at real estate.</p>

<p>These custom, single purpose RSS apps? They'll be cross platform. They won't be installed. They'll have a web component that they tie into. They might look a bit like <a href="http://www.2entwine.com">Gush</a>.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>(Yeah, I know -- long time no post. <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">Personal</a> got split off (again!), and that <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/2">work stuff</a> is keeping me busy)</p>
