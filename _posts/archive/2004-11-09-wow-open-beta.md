<p>The World of Warcraft open beta is now ready for <a href="https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/menu.html">signup</a>.</p>

<p>Once you've created your account, you download a small downloader (both Mac and Windows versions available). This is in fact a downloader which (as far as I can tell from the port ranges used) uses BitTorrent to download the over 2GB installer.</p>

<p>This is an obvious legal use of BitTorrent. And <a href="/node/1378">Shaw is throttling my bandwidth</a>. Grrr.</p>
