<p>Here&#39;s another last minute heads up about a Vancouver event you might want to attend. It&#39;s the launch of the <a href="http://www.socialmediaclub.org/">Social Media Club</a> in Vancouver (on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/121064/">upcoming</a>).</p><p>We&#39;ve been bumping into Chris Heuer, the co-founder of SMC, at conferences and un-conferences all over the place. When he asked to use our new Bryght offices for a kick off meeting in Vancouver, we said sure! this is right up our alley. </p><p>Here&#39;s the blurb on what SMC is:</p><blockquote><span><p>Chris Heuer, co-founder of Social Media Club, will be in Seattle on December 6th and Vancouver on December 7th to officially launch the local chapters in each city. If you are in the area and interested in social media and the intersection of journalism, activism, marketing and technology - we encourage you to join us and meet your peers to share best practices, while working towards the establishment of ethics and standards and promoting media literacy.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">We will discuss &ldquo;The Rise of Social Media&rdquo; and review the latest in tools, technologies and success stories. Chris will share accomplishments from other chapters and suggest possible next steps. The goal of Social Media Club is for each chapter to set goals, meet regularly and share opinions on the role of social media in the present and future of PR, marketing and journalism.</p></span></blockquote><p>Chris, you should ping the people over at <a href="http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotvan/">Dorkbot Vancouver</a>...seems like there might be some like-minded spirits there.&nbsp;</p><p>See you at 1 Alexander tomorrow night (aka Thursday, December 7th, at 6pm).&nbsp;</p>
