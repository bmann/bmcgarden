<p>Yes, this is about the great <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">nofollow </a>debate. Except it's not a debate -- like <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/000954.html">Paul Kedrosky</a>, I'll quote Matthew Skala:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm really concerned about anything that is sold on a pretext nobody can argue with. Nobody can speak out against fighting spam

<p>Like John Battelle, I worry about unintended consquences:</p>

<blockquote>
My gut take on this yesterday was &quot;We're making a decision without thinking through the implications.&quot; My second gut take was &quot;We can't possibly imagine all the implications.&quot; So my third gut take is &quot;Don't do it if we can't imagine what consequences it might have.&quot;

<p>Spam already doesn't make it onto my site. I get lots, they sit in my approval queue, and I ignore them. So why do I care? It's not solving the problem, but it will change the structure of the searchable web.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm going to point to Ben Hammersley for the last word on this.</p>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/18.html#a9229">Scoble points out how it can be used in other ways</a>, and undermines the second aspect of the attribute: as respecting rel="nofollow" will involve loosing an enormous amount of implicit metadata, any tools that are interested in that will be forced to ignore it. Technorati will have to choose if it’s a site that measures raw interconnectivity, or some curious High School metric of look-at-that-person-but-don’t-pay-her-any-attention that the selective use of the rel="nofollow" attribute will produce. For many purposes, this would mean the results are totally debased and close to useless.

<p>So. This won't help, it will actually aggravate the problem by shifting to non-technical blogs (arms race), thus harming the entire industry. On top of that, removing *some* outgoing links will represent a skewed view of what's going on online.</p>

<p>In any case, I'll be following this whole thing with interest.</p>
