<a href="http://www.plutohome.com/html/">Pluto</a> sells a Linux-based system that enables whole-home automation, with everything from telecommunications to security features.

It's annoying that most of the information about the system is "hidden" in the <a href="http://www.plutohome.com/flash/">Flash version</a> of the site.

There are also little details on the specs of this system. I really wish that there was more standards work in this home gateway/server/automation area. Well, I guess it actually needs more publicity -- <a href="http://www.osgi.org/">OSGi</a> still looks to be moving along, and is even being used as an automotive platform as well.

But read on for a brief run-down on the Pluto system.

The system's main server component is called the <em>Core</em>. It sits next to your wiring closet and includes PBX functionality, media storage, as well as all the standard server systems of web serving, email, etc.

The <em>Media Director</em> plugs into a TV and/or stereo and serves media from the Core. It also serves as a fully functional PC if you add a keyboard, using your TV as the monitor.

Lastly, the <em>Orbiter</em> modules are the control devices, coming in either tablet-like form or the "mobile orbiter", which is like a cordless phone.

These types of solutions are fine for the well-to-do that are looking for systems to power their homes, but they simply aren't suitable for mass deployment. Apparently, a typical whole-home system will run you around $15K! Standards that can be used by device manufacturers as well as service providers is what will truly drive adoption.
