Zach Wily has come out of hiding and and publicly released <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iPhotoToGallery 0.2 Beta</a>.

The plugin for iPhoto adds a tab to the export screen that allows you to upload your pictures from iPhoto directly into Gallery.

I've been beta testing it, and have had exactly zero problems with it. Note to Zach: make the front/news page an RSS feed! Also: nice screenshot of the Panther version of iPhoto...
