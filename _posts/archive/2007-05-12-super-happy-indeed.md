<p>Yep, Super Happy indeed.</p><p>Well, the week was busy and Luke and I just sort of pulled everything together at the last minute, but <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?super_happy_grow_op_dev_house#edit">Vancouver&#39;s first SHDH</a> went pretty darn well, I think. Like I said, we were long on the Super and the Happy. Maybe not so much Dev, but I had an absolutely awesome number of great conversations. And we really did go all the way to 1am....we could have gone longer if the keg of beer hadn&#39;t run out *hours* earlier (another surprise, that...).<br /></p><p>Connected in particular with <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/">David Ascher</a>....who I&#39;ve had great convo&#39;s with in the past, but found out a little more about him this time around. Hmmm. Vancouver Open Source Mafia. I like it :P I didn&#39;t really find out about <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>, which David was mumbling about...something for <a href="http://acko.net">Steven</a> to dive into, I think.</p><p>Was great to see everyone. A BCIT broadcast/journalism team grabbed a bunch of video, so we&#39;ll see how that turned out. Can&#39;t link/shout out to everyone, but here are a few links/one liners of interest.</p><ul><li>Great to see <a href="http://www.miss604.com/2007/05/superhappydevhouse-live-blog.html">Miss604</a> and hubby <a href="http://audihertz.net/">John</a>; hire John ... he&#39;s all about the Drupal now, and even legal to work here now</li><li>Always good to see <a href="http://www.duanestorey.com">The Duane Storey</a>; that much tequila probably shouldn&#39;t stay in our office :P </li><li><a href="http://www.ivantohelpyou.com/blog/2007/05/super-happy-grow-op-dev-house.html">Ivan did a great job of doing paper and pen coverage of the event</a>. You may remember him as &quot;that live spam guy&quot; from Lee and Nancy&#39;s Northern Voice 07 talk<br /></li><li>Ended up talking about <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Valve&#39;s Steam</a> game download service (more on this in a separate post, likely) with <a href="http://randomdude.com/blog/">Dustin Sacks</a>. <a href="http://www.poxnora.com">PoxNora</a> is an online + Java Web Start kind of collectible card game + strategy game that illustrates, for me, a really nice balance of how games can / should be deployed as well. Dustin -- something along this line for website integration with &quot;Lux Online&quot; might be interesting....collect army cards?!?</li><li><a href="http://foolswisdom.com/shdh-v1/">Lloyd</a> was missed. Victoria: so close, and yet so far away (P.S. SHDH and SHDHVan)&nbsp;</li><li>All the <a href="http://freegeekvancouver.org/">Freegeek Van</a> folks kick an incredible amount of a** -- feels like new energy and kindred spirits to kick it up a notch here in Van... <br /></li><li>(Later) And of course, catch up with <a href="http://nearlyfree.org/vancouver-hack-thon">Keith Grennan</a>, who is doing cool things with grant management software (although it looks like he won&#39;t get to build it with his new love, Drupal; yes, a Pingback module [or taking over the existing Trackback, and making it PB compatible too] is a good idea) </li></ul><p>(Man, this is getting long, and I haven&#39;t even done the <a href="http://scotthadfield.ca/">Hadsie</a>, <a href="http://mackhardy.ca/">Mack Hardy</a>, or <a href="http://www.buffmuthers.com/~midge/archives/2007_05.html#000732">Ariane</a> shout outs...that&#39;s it for now, see y&#39;all soonish)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a>, <a href="http://www.sophos.com">Sophos</a> -- thanks for coming, and thanks for supporting with beer and pizza delivery. <a href="http://vpfree.pinkbike.com/bb/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2&amp;">Radek Burkat</a> gets the spontaneous rib steak donation award :P<br /></p><p>Next up: <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">DemoCampVancouver</a>, May 24th. Yes, this blog IS filled mainly with event announcements :P One of these days, the great merging of <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">personal</a> etc. and upgrading will happen...<br /></p>
