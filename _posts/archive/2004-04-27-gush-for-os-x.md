<p>&#8230;the OS X (Panther) release of Gush is finally here. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's getting there.</p>
(Update: There's a Gush OS X screenshot on <a href="http://nowhere.2entwine.com">Going Nowhere</a>).</p>

<p>Downloaded. Double-clicked. Needed to get an update for <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&P2_Platform=MacOSX">Flash Player on OS X</a>.</p>

<p>Wow. A giant Flash app. A desktop version of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>? I'm getting some similar vibes. Interesting to see these recent <em>good</em> Flash apps.</p>

<p>Will have to have some other folks try it with me to see how the IM/blogging/etc. work together. It looks pretty, which goes back to some very early discussions on how form can indeed help with function. Perhaps a tad slow, and option-click on the Mac gets you a contextual menu if you were looking how to do stuff.</p>
