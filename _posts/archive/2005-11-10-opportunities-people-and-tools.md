<blockquote> Tools never change anything. It is people seeing opportunities and grabbing them with those tools that change things. <a href="http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/001822.html">Ton's Interdependent Thoughts: Three years ago today...</a> </blockquote>  <p>This is a great quote from Ton, as he posts on the three year anniversary of blogging. I'd like to think that I'm interested in making tools that make it really easy for people to see opportunities. That flexible tools can help people. But without the people, the tools can do nothing -- we are not like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, with dancing brooms toiling away. In man vs. machine, I am on the side of man....except I still try and build a better machine, and delete in the tinkering involved. Every new bolt I add, I see a new opportunity open up, and hope by making those tools available, people's opportunities will expand.</p>  <p>Happy anniversary, Ton. May every tool you choose open new opportunities.</p>
