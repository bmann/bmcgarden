We did it...or will do it. We&#39;re going to have another <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca" title="Canada&#39;s personal blogging and technology conference">Northern Voice</a>!</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> did I mention it&#39;s going to be out at the UBC Forest Sciences Centre? Which is fantastic, according to these pictures from Cyprien. <br /></p><p>Our &quot;mandate&quot; has always been to make a highly accessible event that would be of interest and educational for a wide range of people. For people who aren&#39;t necessarily techies and/or who haven&#39;t been exposed to some of the stuff we cover on personal blogging and other tech (who also tend to be local Vancouverites...can we get non-techies from other cities to come?), I like to think Northern Voice gives them a bit of a taste of what&#39;s new. Not necessarily new-bleeding-edge, but new-you-can-use-it-now.</p><p>Maybe techies are tired of Blogging 101, Wiki 101, and Photo Sharing 101. I know we can keep giving these sessions <em>every single year</em>. And you, the techie reading this post (hi, <a href="http://www.sevenhillsbnb.com">Mom</a>!), should sit in and share your knowledge and perspective.  </p><p>You know the phrase, &quot;This isn&#39;t your mother&#39;s X?&quot;. Well, Northern Voice <strong>is</strong> your mother&#39;s conference. But the neat part, it&#39;s also for you techies. Cheap, fun, educational, mind-expanding.<br /><br />Right now, the <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">speaker submission</a> page is open. One thing to note....write a good abstract, and take filling that speaker submission form out seriously. We got lots of entries from great folks who just didn&#39;t bother telling us what they would talk about, or make a case for why they should have a session (or un-session, as the case may be). <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com">Colin Brumelle</a> (and yes, he works with me at Bryght), was the only abstract submission that was unanimously voted in on the first pass.</p><p>What kind of submissions do we want to see? Well, let me tell you what <strong>I </strong>would love to see...&nbsp;</p><p>I sat down with <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com">Robert Scoble</a> at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a>, asking him what he would like to see at next year&#39;s Northern Voice (he <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/10/18/giving-away-the-photo-store/">mentioned it briefly</a> talking about <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/10/digging_deepercreative_commons.html">Kris&#39; part in a MediaShift article</a>). We talked about two things: Geolocation and virtual worlds.</p><p>Abstracting this a little, to me it means the <strong>intersection of the physical world with online</strong>. Blogging has always done this -- with people bring pieces of their offline lives online, or helping to make real life connections through communicating online.</p><p>I talked about our mandate -- appealing to a wide range of people. Geolocation and virtual worlds are still new. But, not too new that people can&#39;t start experimenting if someone gives them a few pointers. Flickr now has integrated geotagging, and <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a> continues to explode. Your barber is not unlikely to play <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html#product,n95">Nokia N95</a> has GPS and photo sharing built in.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Go make a great <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">speaker submission</a>, and let everyone know to get their moose, like <a href="http://www.darcynorman.net/2006/10/19/moose-season-is-coming">D&#39;Arcy</a> just did (first post -- nice work!). </p><p>P.S. What can we do as a fun live event? Scoble suggests a photowalk. I think we should do a photowalk plus geocaching plus geotagging plus constructing virtual worlds. Or something :P&nbsp;</p> <!--break-->
