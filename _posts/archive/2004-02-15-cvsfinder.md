<blockquote>
cvsFinder is an attempt to integrate CVS into the Mac OS file manager, Finder.  The end goal is to provide all the features of command line CVS through integration with the file manager.  Most of the work is done in Cocoa and Objective-C.   Inspiration for this app comes from <a href="http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseCVS</a>.
