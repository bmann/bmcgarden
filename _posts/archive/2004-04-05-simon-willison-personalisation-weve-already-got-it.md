<blockquote><p>No computerised system could possibly compete with 130 hand-picked human editors, working around the clock to channel interesting information in my direction. Blogs are conversations, but they are also filters. Never before in my life have I had to invest so little effort in finding so much diverse  and fulfilling content. As a certified infovore I don't know how I survived without them.</p><p>What this means for traditional news media is anyone's guess. It's certainly not going to die out: someone has to collect the news and there's only so much unpaid bloggers can do in that regard. We certainly live in interesting times.</p><cite><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/04/05/blogsAsFilters">Simon Willison: Personalisation? We've already got it</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>With <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com" title="Vancouver news">UrbanVancouver.com</a>, we're trying to experiment with this fact: use humans to do filtering, use humans to do categorization. We have computers do the tedious part of aggregating and searching, then we decide what sticks.</p>

<p>Simon also linked to <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/business/1078349998.php">Vin Crosbie's "What Newspapers and Their Web Sites Must Do to Survive"</a>, which I have to take some time and go through in detail.</p>
