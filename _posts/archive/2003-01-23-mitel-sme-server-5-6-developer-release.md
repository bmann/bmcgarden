If you haven't yet tried the <a href="http://www.e-smith.org">E-smith</a> server for your home server box, perhaps now is the time to try this developer release.
<blockquote>
Mitel Networks is pleased to announce the availability of the unsupported developer release of version 5.6 of the SME Server. We strongly recommend all users upgrade to this release.

This release is based on the Linux 2.4 kernel, uses the "ext3" journalling filesystem, has enhanced Windows and Macintosh client support and the packet filtering code has been upgraded to include stateful packet inspection.
