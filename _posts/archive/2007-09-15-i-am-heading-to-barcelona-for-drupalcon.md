<p>So, I'm madly rushing around the house throwing stuff together, doing laundry, etc. (Later: I'm plugged in at the airport, waiting to board).</p>

<p>Dave set up some <a href="http://feasthouse.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/barcelona-travel-tips-for-tokers-and-foodies/">travel tips</a> for me, and I <a href="http://www.43places.com/entries/view/2347141">asked 43 Places what the best beaches in Barcelona are</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll have time to make the flight to Malta to visit <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a> and Julie. I didn't realize there was a direct flight from Barcelona to Malta. I've still got my fingers crossed that I can shuffle my flight back, so we'll see about this...</p>

<p>Oh, right, why am I going? We've got some client work to meet up around, and that's followed by <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org">DrupalCon Barcelona 2007</a>. This looks to be the largest Drupal event ever, with almost 400 people attending.</p>

<p>Anyone have other tips? Leave a comment! I'm going to try and produce a fair amount of social media, so follow the Flickr stream. See you in 10 days!</p>
