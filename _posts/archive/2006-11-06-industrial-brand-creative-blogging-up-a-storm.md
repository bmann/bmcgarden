<p><a href="http://www.industrialbrand.com">Industrial Brand Creative</a> is a local Vancouver branding and design group. They&#39;re a great bunch of guys, do great design work, and are also slightly nuts.</p><p>They&#39;ve got a great <a href="http://blog.industrialbrand.com">blog</a> called &quot;We&#39;re not wired right&quot;. I guess I would have to agree...the current post features, um, <a href="http://blog.industrialbrand.com/archives/2006/11/if_you_doubt_yourself_wea.html">men&#39;s tight swimwear and some special add-ons</a>.</p><p>I was reminded that I hadn&#39;t &quot;introduced&quot; their blog to lots of other folks when I saw Ben Garfinkel, an IBC Partner and Creative Director, at the Ukrainian Church Perogie dinner last Friday. So, consider them introduced -- one more great piece of the Vancouver ecosystem.  </p><p>P.S. Check out their <a href="http://kitchen.industrialbrand.com/">Kitchen</a> as well...I&#39;d love to have a cook off with their team one of these days...&nbsp;</p>
