<p>So, I ended up attending <a href="http://www.emarketing101.net/about/alexandre-brabant-bio-vancouver/">Alex's</a> birthday party this past Saturday night (great Greek food at the Ouzeri in Kits, BTW). I know that he is a big SEO guy, so I thought I would give the "gift of a link". Alex runs a great consulting firm called emarketing 101, and Alex's title is a <a href="http://www.emarketing101.net/" Title="Vancouver BC Canada Search Engine Marketing (SEM) & Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Services Specialist">Vancouver BC Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Services Expert</a>.</p>

<p>I remember first get interested in search results when I first started with Drupal. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out what worked, and why. I can safely say that I'm nowhere near knowing all of the intricate details and "tricks" of SEO, but I think I still know the basics -- clean HTML code, clean URLs, some logical cross linking of pages (tags are great for this), and so on. And, of course, the three C's -- compelling content constantly.</p>

<p>Will this be a trend? Have other people given links as birthday gifts?</p>
