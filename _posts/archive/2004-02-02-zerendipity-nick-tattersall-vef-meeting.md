<p><a href="http://andrewjones.zerendipity.com" title="Andrew Jones' Zerendipity Profile">Andrew</a> and I met with <a href="http://nicktattersall.zerendipity.com" title="Nick Tattersall's Zerendipity Profile">Nick Tattersall</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="http://www.vef.org" title="Vancouver Enterprise Forum">Vancouver Enterprise Forum</a> today. The Vancouver Enterprise Forum's <a href="http://www.vef.org/web/about.asp" title="Vancouver Enterprise Forum Mission Statement">mission</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
To advance technology entrepreneurship in British Columbia through publicly held forums focused on bringing together members of the technology enterprise community in the sharing and exchange of information with a view to educate and motivate.
</blockquote>

<p>We discussed a couple of different options for integrating <a href="http://www.zerendipity.com">Zerendipity</a> into the structure of the VEF website. We were hoping to add the concept of memberships and logins to the VEF, including a link to the Zerendipity profile of each member.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>One of the things I suggested was profiles for speakers and guests that are Zerendipity-powered. Just like you have a short bio/backgrounder that is "plain" HTML today, this could be replaced by a Zerendipity profile. This profile could also be used by the speaker to post documents (perhaps a soft copy of her presentation?), link to her website(s), and of course show public associations.</p>

<p>We are seeking to extend physical networking venues like the VEF with this <a href="http://www.zerendipity.com/sponsors.aspx">government-sponsored</a> virtual networking tool designed and developed in BC for BC.</p>
