<p>Seems like everywhere I look there are more project/task/document management tools. I mentioned this briefly with the release of <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1102">TasksPro</a>, and then it seemed to keep coming up in conversation.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><a href="http://www.functionpoint.com/index.php">Function Point</a> was pointed out by Troy Angrignon (blog coming soon!). I was all prepared to give scathing commentary, but the app looks pretty slick and integrates a lot of different functions.</p>

<p>In discussing good web application design firms, I remembered <a href="http://www.silverorange.com">SilverOrange</a> -- they won an award for best Intranet in 2001, then won again in 2003 for their redesign. I'm always impressed by companies that aren't afraid to re-invent themselves and their best practices.</p>

<p>I may have a chance to do an overview of this space again in the near future. If anyone has suggestions for either low-cost hosted or open source apps in this space, post a comment.</p>
