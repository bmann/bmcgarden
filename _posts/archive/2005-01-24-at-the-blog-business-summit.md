<p>I'm at <a href="http://www.blogbusinesssummit.com">BBS05</a> in Seattle, so no posts here until I get back. Check my <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann">Bryght blog</a> for a few posts, but this event is so well covered, I'm mainly just trying to internalize a lot of the things I'm learning. Pictures are up on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris">Flickr account</a>, although I've only been bringing my camera to  end-of-day events once I've ditched my laptop.</p>

<p>A selection of people picking up my slack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Common Craft</a> -- he's big in Canada!</li>
<li>My trip-mate, <a href="http://www.willpate.org">Will</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/">Tris Hussey</a>, another great part of the Canadian contingent</li>
</ul>
