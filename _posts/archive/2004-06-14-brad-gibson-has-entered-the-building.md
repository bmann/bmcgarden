<p>I was very happy to <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1220">receive this email</a> from <a href="http://www.bradfordgibson.net">Brad Gibson</a>, a self-confessed regular reader of this site (he made a <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1052#comment-1710">long comment about cancelling Primus</a> a while back).</p>

<p>He credits me on his front page for luring him into Drupal. I've just gone over and read through his site. Subscribed! Lots of good <a href="http://www.bradfordgibson.net/?q=taxonomy/page/or/21" title="Brad Gibson's Current Thinking - Canadian Politics">Canadian content</a> and good <a href="http://www.bradfordgibson.net/?q=taxonomy/page/or/26" title="Brad Gibson's Current Thinking - VoIP">thoughts on VoIP</a>.</p>
