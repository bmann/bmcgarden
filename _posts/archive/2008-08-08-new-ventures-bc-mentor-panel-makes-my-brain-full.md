<p>It seems that when I am working with a lot of different ideas and companies, that what I post here really dries up. And that's the case right now.</p>

<p>I went through 8 startup presentations yesterday at <a href="http://www.newventuresbc.com">New Ventures BC</a>, check out my post at Bootup Labs: <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2008/08/08/new-ventures-bc-2008-mentor-panel-two/">
New Ventures BC 2008 Mentor Panel Two</a></p>

<p>So, between one day mind melting events like the NVBC mentor panel and all the new companies and founders I'm being exposed to at Bootup Labs, I'm processing lots of information and giving direct, "live" feedback. I've still got lots of ideas floating around, they're just not making their way into blog posts :P</p>

<p>And yes, I really am not posting local Vancouver tech event stuff here anymore. Check out the <a href="http://bootuplabs.com/events" title="Vancouver technology events at Bootup Labs">Bootup Labs event listings page</a>.</p>
