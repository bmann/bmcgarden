<p>VMS3.info looks at the <a href="http://vms3.info/Jan2004/feature.article.htm">major social networking sites via the Value Framework</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
This analysis examines nine firms in the industry, exploring their similarities and differences. Each firm brings a new perspective or feature to the mix. The users, members, and customers decide which are valuable and which are not.
</blockquote>

<p>The actual analysis is quite "light", but it was interesting to see 22 different companies identified as "social networking sites". I never really considered Classmates.com to be one, but really it is -- it doesn't matter that I don't like their business model and haven't found any useful features...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerendipity.com">Zerendipity</a> wasn't included, but that's likely because of its (to date) exclusivity and geographic base/bias in Vancouver.</p>
