<p>I never did post anything about the great time I had on Friday night, and since <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/2004/09/vancouver-shout-outs-and-name-dropping.html">Kris Krug just did a massive &quot;shout out&quot;</a>, I should probably say at least a thing or two.</p>

<p>I knew I had to meet with Kris while he was in town, plus I missed a meeting with Ean earlier in the week, so I emailed a small group of people and figured we might have 8 or 10 people turn up. Well, by the time <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy</a> got through his rolodex, <a title="The Blogfather - Vancouver" href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a> posted it to his weblog, and Kris invited his posse along, I think there were 20 or 30 people there over the course of the evening. Lots of good people, lots of good discussion.<br /></p>

<p>It was me that ordered the snacks -- I was just too busy talking German: it turns out that <a href="http://www.analyticsonline.ca/about_ej.html">Ean Jackson</a>, <a href="http://www.cielosystems.com">Djun Kim</a>, and (of course, look at his name!) <a href="http://www.invers.com/">Rudi Six</a> all speak it. So, expect some sort of German event in the near future.</p>

<p>I actually took some pictures, but wasn't paying attention and/or had the spirit of <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> (another German speaker) in me, so they're a bit blurry. Check them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/tags/steamworks/">Flickr</a>.</p>
