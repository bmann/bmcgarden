<p>I've played with <a href="http://postrank.com">PostRank</a> in the past (probably back when they were called Aide RSS). They're a Canadian company, based out of Waterloo, founded back in 2007 (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/aiderss">CrunchBase entry</a>). They're best known for their "PR" - ranking on blog posts to see if it is important. Since this is similar to what <a href="http://summify.com">Summify is doing with their social news reader</a>, I'm hoping there might be a connection here.</p>
<p>I dived back into it in the last couple of days because I got notification about <a href="https://connect.postrank.com/about">PostRank Connect</a>, which is a brand / influencer connector / tracker (as near as I can tell - it's not really "turned on" at the moment).</p>
<p>But PostRank analytics is what is live now, and it's <strong>great</strong>. Here's a screenshot of the front page of this blog, the default "Overview" tab in PostRank:</p>

<p>The top is the engagement value as tracked by PostRank - comments, tweets, delicious bookmarks, and so on that that post has generated. The bottom are page views from Google Analytics - you click a button, do the OAuth dance, and then connect in your existing Google Analytics account.</p>
<p>Most of the traffic to my blog is organic search from being around for 10 years, so you don't see massive spikes of pageviews correlated to engagement.</p>
<p>Here's another screen shot from the "analyze" tab, which shows you a compact view of posts to your blog, with engagement events and engagement points to give you an overview of how impactful each post is:</p>

<p>If you look carefully, you can see that the Twitter and Delicious links are underlined - you can click through and see more info about who has tweeted / bookmarked your posts. I'd like to see click throughs and info for all of them.</p>
<p>You can see more details about the PostRank Analytics service on the <a href="https://analytics.postrank.com/tour">tour</a> page, where you'll also find that it is $9 / month or $99 / year, although I've been told that with a "Connect" account, you'll get a free Analytics account.</p>

<p>The Connect / Brand / Influencer model seems to be hot again: when I heard about<a href="http://www.wmediaventures.com/news/new-investment-empire-avenue-the-worlds-first-influence-stock-market/"> Boris Wertz's investment in Empire Avenue</a>, I spent some time kicking the tires as well. Feel free to <a href="http://www.empireavenue.com/BMANN">buy some shares in ticker symbol BMANN</a>.</p>
