<blockquote>
A change in the cost and ease of syndication will cause far more <em>types</em> of information to be syndicated -- not just news, and certainly not just blogs. That is what is interesting about all of this, and it is baffling to me that so few people get it.

<p>On my to-do list has been a brain storming session about types of information that would benefit from syndication, preferably with some non-techies in the mix as well. And the other half of syndication (the consumption part), needs to be abstracted away by saying "Would you like to be notified when X happens?" or something of the sort -- like explaining that PubSub "searches the future".</p>
