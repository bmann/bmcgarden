I bought this a little while back, made by <a href="http://www.arkon.com">Arkon Resources</a>. It's not very good (analog tuning, not even an LED to show you whether it's on or off), but it was very cheap.<br>
<br>
I wanted it so that we could play our MP3s in the living room, for which it works fairly well. Also, I wanted Rob to hack it and up the power so I could run my own pirate radio. Another downside is that there is no audio pass-through. Since it plugs into the headphone jack of my Mac, it mutes the local audio.<br>

I also took it to our ultimate game the other day, combined with a portable CD player and Kate's <a href="http://www.freeplay.net/website/product/radios.php">wind-up radio</a> (it's an earlier model which isn't made anymore). The wind-up radio also has only analog tuning, so it's hard to get it right. And since I was using the very low end of the band -- 88MHz -- Dave pointed out to me on the digital tuner in his car, that apparently they "skip over" 88Mhz.<br>
<br>
I'm still looking for a "good" version of this, ideally with:
<ul>
<li>Digital frequency selection</li>
<li>Audio pass-through (although this could be accomplished with a male-to-2-female y-connector)</li>
<li>Longer range</li>
<li>Less distortion (it only sounds clear when I set the radio to mono FM)</li>
</ul>
