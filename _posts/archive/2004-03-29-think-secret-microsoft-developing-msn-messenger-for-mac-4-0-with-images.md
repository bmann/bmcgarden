<blockquote>
A pre-release version of MSN Messenger for Mac 4.0 recently leaked out of Microsoft's MacBU and suggests that the MacBU plans to further intertwine the instant messaging client with its Office productivity suite. Sources offered several images of the beta at work. <cite><a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/msnmessenger4.html">Think Secret</a></cite>
