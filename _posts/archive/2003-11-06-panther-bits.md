Through <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/11/04/new_design.html">Joi Ito</a>, I found another Boris. I read his item about <a href="http://bopuc.levendis.com/RowBoat/archives/-2003/11/02/crippled_ftp_in_panther.php">Crippled FTP in Panther</a>. Basically, you can now (reliably -- it was there in earlier versions, just didn't work that great) mount FTP sites on the desktop. BUT...it's read-only.

Yes, that's pretty dumb. Speculation ranges from "write-access FTP is a security risk" to "Apple wants iDisk to look more attractive". I would agree with both.

<a href="http://www.codepoetry.net/archives/2003/10/24/panthers_major_text_services_upgrade.php">Text services</a> seem to have gotten a major overhaul in Panther. I now understand why Adobe considers Apple a threat. I mean, scriptable/programmable <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/imageevents/">image processing at the OS level</a>?! And, of course, Text Edit reads/writes Word .doc files as well...

<a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=235">Mac OS 10.3.1</a> already appears to be on its way.
