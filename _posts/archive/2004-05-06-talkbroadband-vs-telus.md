<p>Troy, even though <a href="/node/view/1128">he's new at this blogging thing</a>, has posted a great pros and cons review of his new Primus TalkBroadband service versus his previous Telus service.</p>

<p>It's very realistic and points out some of the failings of Primus' system, but in the end he states this:</p>

<blockquote>
So my phone quality is good to non-existent and my message waiting [indicator] on my phone doesn't work, but I'm going to save another $600/year on long-distance and can have 5-way calling (which I'll only use once per month or so.) Was it a fair trade? Probably not. <strong>But I'm not going back. I'm going to keep going forward because I'm sure they'll work it out.</strong>
