<p>Kaliya announces that she is helping to unconference an <a href="http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=344">Identity Open Space in Vancouver in July</a> (aka IOSVan):  </p><blockquote> 	<p>I am excited there will be <strong>open space identity</strong> event in the <strong>northwest </strong>that will provide an opportunity for <strong>Identity Gang participants </strong>in the region along with the <strong>Web 2.0</strong> development community and the <strong>social good techies</strong> there to come together with <strong>Liberty Alliance participants </strong>and broaden the dialogue around the technical and social issues surrounding user-centric identitiy.  This is NOT the next IIW that will be in November. </p> 	<p><a href="http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/IdentityOpenSpace">The Identity Open Space</a> is being jointly produced by the <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.net">Internet Identity Workshop</a> and <a href="https://www.projectliberty.org">Liberty Alliance</a> July 20-21 in Vancouver Canada.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I&#39;m:</p> <ul> <li>excited that this is taking place in Vancouver -- thanks to the <a href="https://www.projectliberty.org">Liberty Alliance</a> and local Sun representative <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a></li> <li>happy that Kaliya is being unconference woman and will undoubtly do a good job</li> <li>signed up already</li> <li>might not be able to go because I&#39;ve had an unexpected trip to Germany come up...doh!
