<p>Troy posts some predictions for Apple's October 12 event. He figures <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/9/1289722.html">Intel-based Powerbooks and iPod Minis that have no hard drives</a>. He also says &quot;I really doubt all this nonsense about video iPods. I just can't see it. Video is not that useful to people&quot;.</p>  <p>Well, I've already speculated that an <a href="/blog/bmann/video-ipod-or-airport-express-video">Airport Express Video</a> might be more likely than a video iPod (I would buy a Sony PSP over a video iPod...but that would mean Apple would need to allow Fairplay DRM to be built into the PSP, which seems unlikely).</p>  <p>I've been writing about <a href="/macosx/rumours/itunes-movies">iTunes Movies</a> since October 2004...when the iPod Photo came out. I really do think video is &quot;useful&quot; to people. At least, in the small world of anecdotal stories.</p>  <p>Apple has stopped posting new music video content for the past couple of weeks. This seems to be one indication that *something* with video is coming. What if they did offer video content? Movies? TV Shows? I mean, <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a> is already going to be <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050926-102229">offering UPN's &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;</a>.</p>  <p>I would pay for video. I don't have cable, but I do have a very nice screen and computer. I have no way of getting legal video content. The posting <a href="http://www.eirikso.com/2005/06/06/how-bob-the-millionaire-became-a-pirate/">How Bob the Millionaire Became a Pirate</a>, describing how it is impossible to get video online, is a good illustration of the problem.</p>  <p>What would Apple price video at? Movies vs. TV shows would of course have separate pricing. I can't see movies going for any less than $9.99. So let's say TV shows are $4.99 each. That's 5 shows per month vs. basic cable at $25, or 13 shows per month vs. full cable at $65. The numbers seem to make sense...if the movie industry actually makes it possible.</p>  <p>Of course, copyrights are once again per country, so it will be years before we get this in Canada. Regardless of what the &quot;one more thing...&quot; is, we're all looking forward to the unveiling this Wednesday.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.jeremyhubert.com/os-x/ipod-video-at-the-oct-12-apple-event/" target="_self">Jeremy Hubert</a> whispers about inside sources, suggesting that there are indeed video *things* in the works for tomorrow. As well, Roland and I went to <a href="http://www.simply.ca/" target="_self">Simply Computing</a> today, and they are out of stock on PowerMacs and PowerBooks. Will it, in fact, not be one more thing, but but a bunch more things?&nbsp;</p>
