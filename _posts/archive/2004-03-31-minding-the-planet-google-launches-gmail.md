<blockquote>Google has announced the beta of their new search-based free hosted e-mail service, called <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/040331/315958_1.html">gmail.</a> They will provide 1 gigabyte of free storage to every user, with built-in indexing and search. Wow.<cite><a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/03/google_launches.html">Minding the Planet: Google Launches gMail</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>This is big news. Wow is right, Nova.  Somebody had to get this right, since Hotmail certainly wasn't getting any better, and the broadband providers were doing a cr*p job with anti-spam and anti-virus (or charging for it!).</p>

<p>I'm pretty much immediately going to recommend everyone that doesn't have their own email account and/or is currently using Hotmail or Yahoo should use this.</p>

<p>Please, please let this not be an early April Fools...</p>
