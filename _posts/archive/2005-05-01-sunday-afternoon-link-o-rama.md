<p>It seems like Sunday afternoons are better for linking than thinking.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://protagonist.co.uk/dashLicious/">dashLicious</a>: a Mac OS X Tiger Dashboard widget that lets you add links to del.icio.us; needs to add Firefox support and then I can ditch the bookmarklet I use right now</li>
<li>Richard Eriksson writes on <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2005/04/30/creative-commons">Creative Commons hooking up with BzzAgent</a> and how disappointed he is; makes me want to use phrases like &quot;tour-de-force&quot; and &quot;definitive write up&quot;</li>
<li>More Vancouver-local talent, <a href="http://www.davidrdgratton.com/">David RD Gratton</a>; apparently <a href="http://www.bryanrieger.com">Bryan</a> coerced him back into blogging; he's thinking about <a href="http://www.davidrdgratton.com/archives/2005/04/another_reason.html">music DRM right now</a>; go subscribe and keep up with him if you can</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> linked to this <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/reviews/n/5358.html">Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard</a> -- I had one of these for my first PDA, a Handspring; I can see how this might be useful for on-the-fly anywhere reporting/blogging -- I could do this with my Nokia 6630 + GPRS; but, I've never had good success with these accessory accessories...I always lose the dream and stop using them...</li>
<li>Skype now has an <a href="http://www.skype.com/partners/affiliate/">affiliate program</a> (via <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/blog/_archives/2005/4/30/635119.html">Tris</a>); I'll add it to my banners here</li>
<li>The infamous-yet-anonymous :P Holycola is <a href="http://holycola.net/archives/000773.html">rockin' Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger</a>, and here's my favourite quote: &quot;Tiger unifies applications and their data like only some kind of high-end database could before, and does it with elegance. If that isn't a major change, I don't know what is.&quot;</li>
