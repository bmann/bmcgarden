<p>Dave Winer pointed out some interesting implementations of OPML and US weather forecasts:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.rssweather.com/hw3.php?pands=new+york%2Cny&config=&forecast=zandh">RSS Weather</a> has OPML files for every state. Here's the <a href="http://www.rssweather.com/opml/us_wi.opml">one</a> for Wisconsin, and here's what that data looks like in an OPML <a href="http://scriptingnews.worldoutline.com/2005/July/07/RSS%20Weather%20feeds%20for%20Wisconsin/">directory</a>.

</blockquote>

<p>I'm still highly ranked in Google for the phrase because of some previous notes on the subject: <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/333">RSS Weather</a>. No one has implemented what I thought would actually be interesting at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
An extra-cool feature would be supporting TrackBacks/referrers so that you could see the comments/blog entries that people were making about the weather -- certainly something that people in Canada are likely to do.
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, what actually prompted this post was an email from Rob at <a href="http://www.pirateweather.com">Pirate Weather</a>. Yes, <a href="http://www.pirate-monkey-ninja.org">pirate</a> weather. They've taken weather in RSS a step further -- you can actually subscribe to a <a href="http://www.pirateweather.com/weather/podcast/yourzipcode.htm">podcast weather forecast for your zipcode</a>.</p>

<p>Yaar!</p>
