Here&#39;s the <a href="/node/1441">last time I predicted tablet specs</a>. But, of course, Steve Jobs wouldn&#39;t call it a phone or a tablet....he wants a new category.</p><p>And yes, in my <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/01/08/boris-manns-macworld-2007-predictions-no-iphone-but-table-like-thingie">video interview with Roland yesterday, I said &quot;no iPhone&quot;</a>. I should have more clearly said &quot;not a phone&quot; -- because it really is a new category.</p><p>Both OS X and Safari Webkit are &quot;platforms&quot;. What can we build on top?<br /></p><p>The Google <strong>AND</strong> Yahoo partnership is amazing. Click to call. EDGE + Wifi.</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m excited...it&#39;s like a new age of computing + mobile has dawned. </p><p>Prediction on biggest complaints: availability, screen scratches/broken-ness, battery life&nbsp;</p>
