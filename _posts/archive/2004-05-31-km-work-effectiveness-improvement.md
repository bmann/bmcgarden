<blockquote>
As noted above, KM has traditionally been about building and populating databases with useful content, creating portals -- generally, making more information readily available. The consequence has often been to drown workers in hard-to-find information of dubious value just in case they should find themselves in a position to use it. We have actually made workers' intellectual activities harder rather than easier, by presuming, top-down or back-office-to-front-lines, to understand what information they need, and how, when and why they need it. In a world where jobs are more and more specialized, and everyone's information needs are increasingly unique, it's not surprising that KM has failed to live up to its promise.

<p>There's something missing in here about serendipity -- sometimes "non-value added time" can be very hard to identify. But overall, this is a very good post from Dave Pollard.</p>
