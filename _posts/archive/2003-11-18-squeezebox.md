[image:702,left,5,5]Greg first pointed out the release of <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_overview.html">Squeezebox</a> to me.

The company, <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/index.html">Slim Devices</a>, originally developed the SLIMP3, a very bare-bones device. This current version looks much more retail. The cost is $299US, which seems a bit high for a single-function device.

The server software, <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html">SlimServer</a>, works on all platforms (it's written in Perl) and even integrates with iTunes on both Mac and Windows, including Smart Playlist support.

[image:703,left,5,5]Its main advantages seem to be that it is a very simple device, and that it has all required audio outputs, including a digital audio out.

For the money, I would probably choose a <a href="http://www.prismiq.com">Prismiq</a> which also does photos and video. The Prismiq is $349CDN, and is actually available at FutureShop in Canada. At first glance it looks Windows-only, but the <a href="http://www.prismiq.org">associated open-source site</a> has the Linux server available.
