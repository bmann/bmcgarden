<p>I'm filling out the <a href="http://www.vonage.ca/help_contactUs.php">Vonage contact page</a> to ask about switching my phone number to them. The contact page is pretty smart -- it asks you to select your General Topic (Sales) then displays some specific questions (I want to transfer my phone number) and then gives me a textarea to put in more info. We'll see what Vonage says when they find out it is a Talkbroadband number. Do <acronym title="Local Number Portability">LNP</acronym> rules apply? I'm about to find outâ€¦</p>

<p>Kate is now using my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/751">T616</a>, so we can ditch Primus Talkbroadband. That is, my use of VoIP will be primarily for experimentation and research. I'll talk more about my recent experiences with Talkbroadband soon (here's the short form: the service got really bad).</p>

<p>The big thing I'm looking forward to is voicemail-via-email and a softphone (yeah, I think <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1241" title="XTen Interface is terrible">that one</a> is my only choice I think).</p>
