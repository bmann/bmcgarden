<p>Putting this together was pretty easy. I have an iSight, so I typed something like "isight video recording" into Google, and got this <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/07/01/isight.html?page=1">MacDevCenter article</a>. It told me to go get <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/broadcaster/">Apple QuickTime Broadcaster</a>, so I did. Make sure to put your network settings to Manual Unicast (as in the screenshot) and it will work fine. Then crunched it down from 40MB to just under 5MB with iMovie. Do I have to go through that step every time? Not sure.</p>
