If you want to connect to a Windows machine (XP Professional or any of the "Server" products), you can actually use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/rdc/default.asp?navindex=s9b">Microsoft's own remote desktop connection</a>.

OS X only, but great if you don't want to clutter your machine with Office, etc. -- just use your local network to have a window open to your Windows box.

Lloyd originally pointed this out to me, and they had pulled the download at some point, but it's up now.
