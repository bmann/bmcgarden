<p>
	I&#39;ve been asked to replace a speaker for an upcoming <a href="http://www.hollyhock.ca/cms/index.cfm?Group_ID=4653">Hollyhock training series on Social Media</a>, presented in partnership with <a href="http://www.octopusstrategies.com/default.htm">Octopus Strategies</a>.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll be giving a &quot;social media primer&quot; this coming Thursday. Here&#39;s what it currently says on the box:</p>
<blockquote>
	Wondering what, exactly, a &#39;Yelp&#39; is? Curious whether Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter can help you move your mission forward? Join [Boris Mann] for an enlightening and entertaining look into the changing landscape of social media tools, techniques and practices. You&#39;ll leave with a clear understanding of all the opportunities social media presents, and insights into how to take advantage of this burgeoning medium.</blockquote>
<p>
	There really is a lot of depth to cover here -- back in the day we only had to cover Blogs and RSS, and now I have to get all the way through microblogging, location based services and iPhone apps, with social networks in between.</p>

<p>
	I&#39;ll be picking up presenter licenses for a couple of <a href="http://commoncraft.com">Common Craft</a> videos. Hard to believe that <a href="http://commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english">RSS in Plain English</a> just had its three year anniversary.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll be posting the outline after the session. The big question: will I skip wikis or include them? :P</p>
<p>
	If you know of someone that&#39;s interested in attending (best for those in non profits / NGOs or larger organizations) you can <a href="https://www.hollyhock.ca/cms/page1528.cfm?group_id=4615:2010.04.29:2010.04.29"><strong>register here &raquo;</strong></a></p>
