<p>Peer 1&rsquo;s world-class Internet network is complemented by Pulver.com&rsquo;s knowledge of the industry. Together, the companies can provide a launching pad for VOIP entrepreneurs with the vision, but not necessarily the financial backing, to take VOIP to the masses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is embracing VOIP,&rdquo; says Jeff Pulver, Founder of Pulver.com, &ldquo;and we are at the forefront of that movement. By identifying and nurturing some key start-ups, we aim to revolutionize the way the world communicates.&rdquo;</p><cite><a href="http://www.peer1.net/press_detail.asp?uid=52">Peer 1: Emerging VOIP companies to get financial assistance from industry veterans</cite></blockquote>
