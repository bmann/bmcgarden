<p>It was supposed to launch a few days ago, the launch slipped, but who cares? It's here! And yes, it's still 99Â¢ per track, so we're saving up here with our Canadian pesos!</p>

<p>Have I bought music? Yep, you bet. First purchase: <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=28659665">Black Eyed Peas, Let's Get it Started (The Urbz Edition)</a>. 4 tracks, $3.96. Canadian.</p>

<p>I've been really enjoying the Black Eyed Peas. For some reason I thought they were from Toronto, but no, they're from LA. But hey, they have their own Sims characters, who can't love them? Seriously, they have a fun mix of songs with good beats, and they've ended up on quite a few <a href="/boris/bmp/cdx2">compilations</a> recently.</p>

<p>Would I have bought that in a store? No way, I don't usually buy singles. But this was *dead simple*. Oh man, I'm afraid to show Kate this...</p>

<p>Craziness...I can even make an iMix now: <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPublishedPlaylist?id=167079">Burning Monkey Productions Presents: CDX2</a> -- on the Apple iTunes Music Store.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> second purchase. <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=28680234">Sarah McLachlan - Afterglow Live</a> -- in part purely because of the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/05/OhSarah">video</a>.  Yeah, it brings tears to my eyes, as do many of Sarah's tracks.</p>

<p>But also, $9.99 for 18 tracks. Hmmm...I'm already starting to think in a "track" way. (Just to turn all that mushiness back into cash and the cold hard tech world we live in)</p>
