<p><a href="http://home.justwerks.com">Evan</a> pinged me with a link to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/devices.html">Apple iSync supported devices list</a>, and sure enough, the 6630 is now listed. Do a Software Update, and iSync goodness should be yours.</p>

<p>Nothing else too exciting to report, although it is great that this is another item in the "just works" category when your device actually is supported.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I set up Kate's T610 (my old phone), to work with the desktop. I keep thinking I should try .Mac to sync both our calendars (and contacts) together, but I just haven't felt enough of a need.</p>
