<p>Lots and lots of rumours about Google and IM. <a href="http://www.hello.com">Hello</a> (part of the <a href="http://www.picassa.com">Picassa</a> purchase) is an IM application -- Windows-only, proprietary protocol, used for image sharing/posting. It is more likely that Google will line up behind Jabber/XMPP, since:</p>

<ol>
<li>many other IM vendors are lining up behind SIMPLE (which is what the telcos/bellheads like, because it's an extension of SIP); Jabber already interoperates with SIP/SIMPLE through a gateway, and is more likely to be backed by internet/web/IP types</li>

<li>Jabber already includes the capability to run "gateways" to other IM services, which would be a mainstream (as opposed to <a href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> on Mac or <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> on Windows) example of an interface that lets you "talk" to all protocols</li>
</ol>

<p>Some thoughts of Google's play include tying gmail IDs into Jabber/IM IDs, potentially even having chat logs stored in a similar, Gmail interface (and showing text ads, which would fit with their business models). Of course, with an ID infrastructure, plus permissions and contact lists, things like filtering email/identifying spam becomes easier as well.</p>
