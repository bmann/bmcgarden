<a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001254.shtml">Dan Gillmor raves about the goodness that is VoIP</a>:
<blockquote>In the past month, I've done my part to undermine a monopoly. How? By making phone calls.</blockquote><a href="http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/">Dana Blankenhorn doesn't think VoIP is all that great</a>, specifically in response to Dan (link points to front page -- permalinks are broken...).

Whatever. I want VoIP at home. Can't get it. Or, at least, can't get it at a reasonable price in Canada. But, I do now have a <a href="http://www.fwdnet.net/">Free World Dialup</a> account. My number is <strong>48340</strong>. Feels like the early days of ICQ -- sign up now to get a low number that shows you're cool!

Of course, now I'm going to have to track down software that will let me work with it on my Mac...no MSN Messenger for me, thanks.

There is <a href="http://www.mac2phone.com/">Mac2Phone</a>, but it seems tied to a particular service (and is a crappily-written Java program). Hmmm...a Google search leads me to believe that <a href="http://www.newtelephony.com/news/638.html">iChat is in fact a SIP client</a>, except it can't really talk to other SIP clients. Double hmmm.

Here are some more likely candidates -- <a href="http://xmeeting.sourceforge.net/">Xmeeting</a> (H.323 only), <a href="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">GnomeMeeting</a> (need to run it under X11, can be installed via Fink). Put links in comments if you find others...
