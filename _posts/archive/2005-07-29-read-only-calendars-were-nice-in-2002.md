<p>Scott points to a <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0507osxserver.html">rumour</a> that Apple is going to use <a href="http://www.hula-project.org/Hula_Server">Hula</a> as a mail + calendaring solution. But, we'd all really just like iCal sharing for small numbers of people:</p>

<blockquote>
The ability to publish read-only calendars was nice in 2002 when it was first added, but it&rsquo;s been three years, and I&rsquo;m still waiting for the ability to share read/write calendars with other family members. I&rsquo;m aware that I could probably do this with <a href="http://www.mac.com">.Mac</a>, but I&rsquo;m not willing to pay $100/year just so I can edit events on my wife&rsquo;s calendar a couple times per week.

<p>Amen, Scott. And, I'd be willing to wager that editing events on a spouse's calendar would be one of the major uses.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/OsconEvents2005">CalDAV BOF</a> that I'm going to attend down at <a href="http://www.bryght.com/events/oscon-2005">OSCON</a>, but really, we're stilling banging our heads over how to properly support true two-way desktop calendar integration. Hula looks like a *big* solution, and <a href="http://daemon.co.za">Adrian</a> reminded me of the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html">post dissing groupware that went with it</a>. For the same reason that blog-like tools are overtaking much larger CMS's, I would argue that a small, nimble, person-to-person focused calendaring solution that is *easy* will win over big groupware.</p>
