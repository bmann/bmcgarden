<p>That sly <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/dparchives/008100.html">Ben Hammersley fellow</a> is at it again. Apparently, Flickr has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/">services</a> which are accessible.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammersley is responsible for <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/linkr">Linkr</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current version of Linkr allows you to authenticate with your Flickr username and password, and then tells you all about the websites your Flickr contacts write.</p>

<p>I say current version because the code is in there to add in the thing I want it to do, namely to display the last x urls those sites themselves link to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other services include <a href="http://erikbenson.com/connectr/" title="Connectr - site down, I have no idea">Connectr</a>, <a href="http://www.pmbrowser.info/playlists/playlists.htm" title="Playr - Flickr Playlists">Playr</a>, and <a href="http://www.reviewr.com/" title="Reviewr -- some sort of review thing, I suspect">Reviewr</a>.</p>

<p>There is some more stuff here. Single  sign on and third-party authentication anyone? Read onâ€¦</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView">Avi</a> will want to look at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/services_auth.pdf" title="PDF - Flickr Services Authentication Documentation">this (PDF)</a> to pick out the holes -- where does it fall down in comparison to his <a href="http://people.squeakfoundation.org/person/avi/diary.html?start=1" title="Minimal Integrated Sign On">MISO</a> suggestion for sign-ons?</p>

<p>While you're at it, Avi, I also found this recent <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/handcrafting_my.html">Life with Alacrity</a> post that mentioned <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html" title="A SImple Distributed Security Infrastructure">SDSI</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.
</blockquote>

<p>Just like I've been saying. Yes, I will run my own profile/authentication server. No problem. Folks without access to a server can get it from hosted sites, like those darn Flickr folks. Actually, Stewart et al at Ludicorp: please give us a GNE/Flickr script snippet written in PHP that we can put on our site.</p>
