<p><a href="http://www.stephanievacher.com/blog/?p=67">Stephanie just posted</a> where her entry ends with the phrase that is the title of this post "a persona who is, above all things, enamoured by the future".</p>

<p>I love the phrase. Maybe time to swap out the tagline for this blog.</p>

<p>Oh, and, Steph actually posted about renewing her Flickr pro account. Related to that, I'm experimenting a bit with <a href="http://www.photophlow.com/">Photophlow</a> -- a real time interface for chatting about Flickr photos. Which, for those of us who remember the early days of Flickr, was actually the original implementation of Flickr. Thanks to <a href="http://www.rachaelashe.com">Rachael</a> for the invite -- I've still got a few to hand out if you're interested.</p>

<p>Finally, great work on the blog, Steph -- I've really been enjoying reading it and enjoying your photos.</p>
