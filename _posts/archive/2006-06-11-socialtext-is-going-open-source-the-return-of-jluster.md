<p>I&#39;ve missed <a href="http://www.jluster.org/">Jonas Luster</a>. I knew he was about to resurface as he left websites in his path -- like the redesign of <a href="http://socialtext.com/">SocialText</a> in Drupal*. Luckily, I stayed subscribed to his RSS feed, and the posts just started pouring in again a couple of days ago. Jonas&#39; title is Open Source Manager for SocialText, Dan Bricklin&#39;s wikiCalc is going to be a part of SocialText...and the whole thing is going open source:</p>  <blockquote> <p>So, here it goes .. Tadaa! Remember Dan Bricklin? The dude whose <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm">VisiCalc</a> turned out to be a greta idea, and even greater invention, and to create hordes of College students trying to memorize cell macros? Well, he joined Socialtext&rsquo;s board and with him <a href="http://wikicalc.org">wikiCalc</a> joined Socialtext. We&rsquo;ll be developing this beast in the months to come, under an OSI compliant <a href="http://www.soicaltext.net/stoss/">Open Source license</a>, of course, and hope you&rsquo;ll find it as useful and cool as we do.</p>  <p>But that&rsquo;s not all. It&rsquo;d be kinda boring to now go back and hang with my homies, so - just in time for the World Cup (<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/soccertext/index.cgi">Socialtext has a Wiki for it, of course</a>), my work starts to bring you <strong>all</strong> of Socialtext as Open Source. Yupp, that&rsquo;s right, my boss and CEO role model <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/">Ross Mayfield</a> spilled them OSI compliant beans today, as well: We&rsquo;ll have Socialtext Open Source by <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON 2006</a>. I&rsquo;ll definitively be in Portland for that, and had a chat with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/nat/">Nat</a>, today, so chances are you&rsquo;ll also see me say something on stage, as well. Yet another reason to sign up, no? :)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Read the rest of the <a href="http://www.jluster.org/articles/2006/06/09/the-riddle-unfolds">Jonas&#39;s riddle on his site</a>. Congrats to everyone involved, this sounds very interesting. And welcome back, Jonas...maybe I&#39;ll actually get to meet you in person one of these days.</p>

<p>(Well, and is making me re-think attendance at OSCON...but I&#39;m committed to EuroOSCON already, so don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be in Portland this year)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Patrick Tanguay wrote in to point out that <a href="http://adaptivepath.com">Adaptive Path</a> did the design of the new SocialText site and his company <a href="http://tasteofblue.ca/">Taste of Blue</a> was responsible for a large part of the rest of the Drupal work. </p>
