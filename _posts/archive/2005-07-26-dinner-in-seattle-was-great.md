<p>Well, <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> is mad at me because we're even farther behind in various projects, but I really wanted to fit this <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1522">trip to Seattle</a> in before going to <a href="http://www.bryght.com/events/oscon-2005">OSCON in Portland</a> next week.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com">Chris</a> for spending your Gnomie points on us at Chinoise, and happy birthday! I still don't get the term &quot;pan asian&quot;...</p>

<p>I keep thinking we should do more cross-border trips specifically to Seattle. Maybe Web 2.0 meetups every month, alternating between Seattle and Vancouver (and Bainbridge?).</p>

<p>After the jump, I'm just going to quote all of <a href="http://www.scottstuff.net">Scott Laird's</a> post, since he nicely covered all the necessary links.</p>

<p>Besides <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2005/07/12/still-flickring">finally</a> meeting <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a>, I got to meet <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Lee</a>, <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/">Kris</a>, Amanda, and a friend of Kris’s who’s name I’ve completely forgotten.  Sorry.  I’d never been to Chinoise before, but I’ll be back soon–great food, wonderful presented.  The conversation was enjoyably geeky; Boris and I double-teamed Lee and Chris on the “you need a <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2005/07/08/nokia-n91-lust">Nokia N91</a>
