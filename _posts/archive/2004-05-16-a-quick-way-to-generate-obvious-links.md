I want a blog editor that will let me select a block of text, and then search Google for me, providing me with a list of URLs from a search for the text provided. Then, when I pick one, the text and URL will be turned into a link. Nothing fancy, just a quick way to generate obvious links. For instance, in the last post, I ended up searching Google a half-dozen times to find good URLs for the links in the post. I wish Ecto could automate that for me.
