<p>I took matters into my own hands and started undergoing the massive effort of rebuilding everything we had loved, onto an open source platform , that did not function as a black box without needing to buy into their proprietary , windows/mac only scripting environment and then still be incredibly limited in the amount of changes I could make.</p>

<p>What I would like to know, is what specific requirements other people have from manila that isn&rsquo;t met by an open platform at present?</p>

adrian is one of Drupal's most prolific developers. Turns out he was just trying to scratch some of his one itches, and in the meantime contributed a ton of code that's massively useful for everyone. I would also be interested to know the delta between manila and any open platforms.
