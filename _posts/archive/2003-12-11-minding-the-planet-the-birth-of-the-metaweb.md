<p>Is it hype? I'm too far gone drinking the Kool-Aid to tell. Go read <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2003/12/the_birth_of_th.html">Nova Spivack</a> and make up your own mind. In short, RSS supplanting email, becoming the primary transport used on the web.</p>

<blockquote>
My projections indicate that within 5 years almost every Weblog will provide an RSS channel of its content. In coming years a large percentage of consumers and professionals are expected to begin blogging -- Weblogs are the new homepages; everyone should have one.

<p>There is more to this than meets the eye -- when people == weblog, this means that a person's profile is their weblog. Or could their profile actually be their weblog?</p>
