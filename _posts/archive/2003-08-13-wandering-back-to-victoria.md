So Graham signed up for Tribes and created a UVic tribe. I thought about it, but I already started the Ottawa one, and didn't want to be "responsible" for another one. There are actually quite a few people that went to UVic online there. I never felt a strong affiliation for the school itself.

But, I wandered over to <a href="http://www.uvic.ca">UVic</a> see if anyone there is doing something with blogging. I did <a href="http://www.google.com/u/uvic?q=blog&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&domains=uvic.ca&sitesearch=uvic.ca&start=0&sa=N">this search</a> (UVic uses Google -- good on them!) and got a bunch of hits.

For one, the <a href="http://chisel.cs.uvic.ca/">Computer Human Interaction and Software Engineering Lab (CHISEL)</a> is <a href="http://chiselog.chisel.cs.uvic.ca/">running Drupal</a>. Likely because of the taxonomy module, which maps nicely with ontologies and other high-falutin' words that get tossed around.

CHISEL has also built some cool tools, like <a href="http://shrimp.cs.uvic.ca/index.htm">SHRIMP</a> -- for "visualizing and exploring software architecture and                       any other information space".

All that stuff just got me thinking about <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/calendar2003/GRAD/GPROGS/CoSc/GPinCS.html">getting a Master's in CS</a>. They even have co-op...

Kate would love that. Actually, Kate would love it if I was a perfessor.

I didn't do enough searching to see if anyone is doing stuff with the use of blogs and education. Collaborative course-ware, discussion forums, RSS feeds, etc. If only we had more time in the day. And on that note, to bed.
