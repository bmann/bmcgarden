<p>What really sucks is the integration between TypePad (or any other hosted blogging platform) and the other services that bloggers need.  Here is a list of things I'd like to be tightly integrated with my blogging platform whether its Typepad or anything else.</p>

<p>Google AdSense (or some other advertising service)<br />
Google WebSearch (or some other site search/web search service)<br />
Bloglet (or some other email subscription service)<br />
Technorati (or some other service to see who is linking to my blog)<br />
SiteMeter (or some other service that tells me how many visitors and page views I get)<br />
Feedburner (or some other service that tells me who is reading my feed)</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.blogware.com">Blogware</a> does do everything on the list except for advertising. Part of the issue is that we are very much still dealing with first-generation type applications. We'll eventually see consolidation in these areas, as the best-of-breed add-ons get bought by hosted blogging platform providers (witness the purchase of <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">Blogrolling</a> by Blogware).</p>
