<category>Application</category><category>Wireless, Cellular, and Mobile</category><p>Just testing these two mobile products. <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com">Litefeeds</a> are a part of the vancouver crew and <a href="http://www.mobrion.com">mojave</a> is the tool we're posting with. We're at kells in seattle about to call it a night.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I edited the above to add links and publish it. I was posting from my Nokia 6630, and it did work, but not completely correctly -- i.e. it didn't post, but was sitting on the blog in unpublished state. <A href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a>, I might actually want to test that Bluetooth keyboard. <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com">Colin</a>: see, it worked!</p>

<p>Trying an edit now.
 Now with the litefeeds guys.</p>
