<p>These are my links of interest, remaindered links, link-list, whatever you want to call it. They've been sitting as open tabs in <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire - Mac News Reader">NNW</a> for far too long. Which leads to a request: a script for NNW that takes all the open tabs and pastes the link for them into a new post in the associated blog editor.</p>

<li><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0111520/2004/11/23.html#a837">Alec Saunders .LOG: Good experience with Zip.ca</a>: he says &quot;I'm pretty impressed!&quot; (I thought it only fair to link to that, given the little <a href="/node/910" title="Zip.ca">complaint thread</a> I seem to be hosting)</li>
<li><a href="http://evans.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/11/24/190629.html">Mark Evans: Comparing VoIP in Canada</a>: Mark writes excellent stuff about telecom in Canada. I don't think anything, even relatively low prices for local phone service, can hold VoIP back (I want features!).</li>
<li><a href="http://scottstuff.net/scott/archives/000327.html">Scottstuff: A few days with MythTV</a>: he's conquered home VoIP with Asterisk, now he's turning his attentions to the video/PVR world</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/001514.html">Ton's Interdependent Thoughts: Bye Bye Ecademy</a>: what he said</li>
<li><a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/12/sales_tools_kee.html">Feld Thoughts: Sales Tools - Keep Them Simple (e.g. A Heat Map)</a>: Excel as fancy-schmancy sales analysis tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://listings.local.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Local Listings</a>: you can get a free local listing for your business or pay for an enhanced one. Is there a format for this? Some sort of &quot;open yellow pages listings&quot;?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rufuswainwright.com/">Rufus Wainwright</a>: I heard the same song on CBC twice today (&quot;The One You Love&quot;, from his &quot;Want Two&quot; album), so I bought the track off iTunes; no incentive to link to iTunes, since I don't get any cash from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phew! That felt good. Safely stored in my backup brain, so I can forget about them.</p>
