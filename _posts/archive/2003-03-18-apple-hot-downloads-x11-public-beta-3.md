Head on out there and <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/x11formacosx.html">start downloading</a>.

I just started using the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office Final Public Beta</a> on OS X (works on Windows, tool you'll hate it if you've spent any time with Office, but it is free and lets you remove one more piece of <strike>pirated</strike> MS software off your Windows machine). It works great with Apple's X11, although what I did end up doing is typing the whole string of commands into the X11 shortcuts menu.

I think one of the main things that X11 needs is a progress indicator somewhere -- it takes 15 - 30sec for the splash screen of OOO to come up, and before that time, there is no way of knowing if something is actually launching in the background.
