<p>The <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/view/77">Vancouver Ecademy event</a> I went to wasn't <em>quite</em> as large, but the speakers were really good and there was an interesting mix of people. I'm meeting with <a href="http://www.ecademy.com/account.php?op=view&id=20095">Stewart Marshall</a> on Monday to talk about the Vancouver Ecademy trusted network.</p>
