<p>Even though I no longer do a lot of <a href="http://www.phenomenalsolutions.com" title="Ottawa-based IT, Web, and Business Consulting for Small Businesses">IT stuff</a>, I'm still interested by many of the problems. Contacts, calendaring, and groupware that <em>isn't</em> Microsoft Exchange continues to be an interesting space.</p>
