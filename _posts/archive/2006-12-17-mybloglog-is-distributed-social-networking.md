<p><a href="http://www.mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog</a> is the closest to distributed social networking I&#39;ve seen. There is no &quot;claiming&quot; of blogs, which is a bit of an issue...they&#39;ll need to add something like that soon.</p><p>They also don&#39;t have identity figured in, plus the most ridiculously long profile information pages which just underscores for me that I really never want to fill out another one of those, and I don&#39;t want to have to set privacy...I want that stuff to just work.</p><p>This might be an interesting purchase for Technorati (which just added OpenID support...).&nbsp;</p><p>Update: and apparently I should <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/2006121113445135/">link to my &quot;community&quot;</a>.&nbsp;</p>
