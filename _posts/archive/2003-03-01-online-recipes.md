After a couple of aborted attempts at keeping track of recipes in my blog (well, I did have some good ones in its previous incarnation, using <a href="http://www.pmachine.com">pMachine</a>), I found a good, stand-alone web app that handles recipes well.

It's called <a href="http://phprecipebook.sourceforge.net">phprecipebook</a> and requires PHP (surprise!) and your choice of database (postgresql and mysql are currently supported).

You can check out my installation at <a href="http://recipes.bmannconsulting.com">recipes.bmannconsulting.com</a>. Not much there right now. By the way, if you see the source as "Dr. Bernstein", it's from a special diet that Kate is on. My cooking usually has more olive oil :)

P.S. Not all of my recipes are rushing online. I got a great homemade recipe book (with my picture on the front, no less) that sits in our kitchen for me to scribble in...at least until we get a computer in there.
