<p>I last wrote about Axentra when they had <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/579">changed their name from OEOne</a> back in October 2003. Marc Benglia, the CEO of Axentra, came by and left a comment on that post, so I went and checked out their <a href="http://www.axentra.com/products/">new products</a>.</p>

<p>Marc had specifically pointed out their <a href="http://www.axentra.com/products/multifunc_server_appliances/home_series_net-box/">Net-Box  Home Series</a>, which are two server appliances targetted at home network use. The entry level model is $499US -- much too expensive in my opinion, but I still understand the lure of having a full-featured server on your own network.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of getting rid of my local Linux server. Obviously I'm not the target market for these products, nor is anyone that can build their own server. But I think that Axentra is going to have trouble explaining the benefits -- and making it easy enough -- for the average end user.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>For example, sharing pictures. This was the main driver for running my own server initially. I have a handful of hosting accounts, and even a dedicated server, but all of them have limited storage space. So, running a local server, where I can run a huge amount of storage (digital pictures at 500KB - 1MB a piece start to add up pretty quickly). But now there's <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>. For a measly $5US/month, I get unlimited storage -- limited only by the 1GB of uploads per month. It has many more features than my <a href="http://gallery.bmannconsulting.com">local gallery</a>, with more being added every day. And it's housed on super-redundant servers, so I don't have to worry about making offsite backups. For $5US/month, that's 100 months of the service before I've made up the cost of the Net-Box.</p>

<p>The big thing I could see myself using one of Axentra's servers for is backup. I'd love to see a server whose main function was really good backup. <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a> linked to a <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=71&categoryid=16">Buffalo Technologies</a> product a while back that seemed to offer that -- and it's $300US for a 160GB model, with the capability of adding external USB 2.0 drives as well.</p>

<p>My message to Axentra is to focus: focus on a small set of features. Yes, Linux-based hardware can do a lot of things, but the only way to differentiate yourself if you do something differently from other products.</p>

<p>Perhaps their <a href="http://www.axentra.com/products/multifunc_server_appliances/office_series/">Office series</a> is a better bet. The consumer market is still a tough one. Of course, lots of competition in the office space as well -- I still like the <a href="http://www.net-itech.com/products/hardware.php">Net Integrator Servers</a>.</p>
