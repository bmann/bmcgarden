End users are looking for stable software. But the Mozilla organization makes it clear to say: "We make binary versions of Mozilla available for testing purposes only!" 

The intention of WaMCom.org is to produce web browser and mail client software that is more stable and more correct than the test releases produced by the Mozilla.org organization, in the hope it is suitable for end users. In order to achieve that, stable Mozilla releases are extended with correctness fixes.

In addition it contains some security and cryptography enhancements.
