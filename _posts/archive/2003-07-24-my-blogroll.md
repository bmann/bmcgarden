Wow. I keep finding <strong>more</strong> stuff that <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> does.

<a href="/aggregator/sources">My blogroll</a> can also be <a href="/aggregator/opml">syndicated via OPML</a>. That is, all the sites that I have subscribed to. You can read all the individual sources in the <a href="/aggregator">news feeds section</a>.

Man, I love Drupal. I need to install the new version. Mmm...that is going to have to go on my <a href="http://www.alexking.org/index.php?content=software/tasks/content.php">tasks</a> list...

I never connected the term &quot;blogroll&quot; with this capability, but that's what it is, even though it's not called that by Drupal. And no one is going to understand it either, unless I put a button somewhere on my front page that is labelled &quot;my blogroll&quot;.

<strong>Update:</strong> I looked for a &quot;blogroll&quot; icon, but I couldn't find one. So, I made my own. Feel free to steal it.
