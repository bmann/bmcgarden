<p><a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/18" title="Todd Bailey's Blog">Todd Bailey</a> emailed me a bunch of pictures of the snowstorm in Newfoundland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these photos from a friend at work - they were taken during last
year's snowstorm in Newfoundland. I had no idea that it ever got that bad?
And no need for the army to dig them out. Speaking of digging out - one
story I was told to accompany these photos was that a road crews had finally
got out when the snow stopped and started digging and uncovered the roof of
a bus - no joke!</p>

<p>Boris: Instead of putting all that CRAZY computer stuff on your website -
put some of these interesting photos! Interesting photos = more web hits.</p>

<p>So, here they are:</p>
