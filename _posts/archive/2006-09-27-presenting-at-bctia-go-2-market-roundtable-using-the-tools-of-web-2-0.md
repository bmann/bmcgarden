It&#39;s taking place at the BC TIA Boardroom.</p><p>What are the tools of web 2.0? Well, the audience will mainly be marketing focused, so we&#39;ll cover some interesting marketing ideas and basic concepts around blogs, wikis, and customer interaction. That&#39;s code for &quot;I need to work on some more slides tonight&quot;. I&#39;ll definitely cover how for small businesses, blog == Better Listings On Google.<br /></p>
