<p>I was amazed when I heard the Xbox 360 would support iPods out of the box. But, of course, it has to. Embrace AND extend.</p>

<p>One of the big take-aways for me was hard drives vs. optical. Everyone knows what a pain it is to burn discs. They're the floppy drive / sneaker net of this era, only being used if there are no other alternatives. So of course Microsoft bypasses them with a portable hard drive.</p>

<p>But basically, click through to Mitch's overview of how the XBox is going to kick the PS3's butt.</p>

<blockquote>
Here's how Microsoft will win the Game Wars by next summer, before the Playstation 3 ships in volume, using a wireless handheld Xbox that plays games, movies and TV stored on the detachable hard drives announced in the Xbox 360&mdash;and, building on .NET, Microsoft will turn both the game console and the portable game system into full-fledged productivity systems.
