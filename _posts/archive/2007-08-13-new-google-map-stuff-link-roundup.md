<p>Continuing with the <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/tags/geolocation">geo</a> theme, I've got a post brewing on what Google is doing and what this means for the growth of geo in general. I tried to get momentum for geo-related stuff for this past February's <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice</a>...but I think I was off by at least a year. Herewith some interesting links and examples of what you can now do with Google and maps.</p>

<p>For example, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/local/add?hl=en&gl=us">add your own business listing to local</a> (and others can even review it, <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?um=1&q=bryght&near=Vancouver,+BC&fb=1&view=text&latlng=49283426,-123104011,6942316115532227902&sa=X&oi=local_result&resnum=1&ct=result">here's the entry for Bryght in Vancouver</a>), and the Google My Maps now makes it really easy to create your own custom maps (e.g. here is my start of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=0&msa=0&msid=108403776136895878523.00000111c289a9a5559e5&z=2">Drupal events around the world</a>). My Maps even lets you add "mapplets" -- different layers that folks create -- <a href="http://maps.google.com/ig/directory?synd=mpl&pid=mpl&features=sharedmap,geofeed">here's the directory</a>, I'm a fan of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/ig/directory?synd=mpl&pid=mpl&features=sharedmap%2Cgeofeed&num=24&url=http://labs.sumaato.net/tools/flickr_mapplet/mapplet.xml">Flickr Mapplet</a>.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a central place that I can trust to "store" my geo-related information. While I still like <a href="http://www.43places.com">43 Places</a>, it's certainly not going to be the only place I put geo-related data. Can I use Google to just act as a giant store for all my geo-related data, and pull it out, remix it, display it elsewhere as needed?</p>
