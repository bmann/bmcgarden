<p>So, we were lucky enough to get a killer deal on our space at the UBC campus for Northern Voice 2007. This meant that we had some money available to do other things with.</p><p>We decided one of the things we wanted to do was to increase the reach of the conference. We&#39;re lucky enough to have a lot of friends travel great distances already to come to the conference, but maybe there&#39;s a really passionate blogger somewhere far away that just doesn&#39;t have the money to be able to travel.</p><p>Today Darren posted the details on the <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/news/2007/01/12/get-a-travel-bursary-for-northern-voice">Northern Voice Travel Bursaries</a> -- six travel bursaries of $500CDN each. We&#39;ll award these based on a blog/video/photo/podcast post that the applicant makes, and then fill out the <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/nvbursary/submit">bursary submission form</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s the middle of January, and I can&#39;t wait for the end of February to roll around.&nbsp;</p>
