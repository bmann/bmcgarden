	That was fast. <a href="http://www.skype.com/products/skypein/">SkypeIn</a>, Skype&#39;s connection of &quot;real&quot; phone numbers to your Skype account, is live.</p>
<p>
	They are offering numbers from Hong Kong, the UK (well, sold out, apparently), France, and the US. I&#39;ve seen <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/blog/_archives/2005/3/12/427517.html">people say they want to wait for Canadian numbers</a> -- I&#39;ll probably just try a US number and get a Canadian one later.</p>
<p>
	So, looking at the list of US area codes, I was trying to figure out what area I would want a number from. I copied out all the area codes and looked them up <a href="http://www.bennetyee.org/ucsd-pages/area.html">here</a>. Below is the list of SkypeIn area codes and what area of the US they are connected with:</p>

	Hmmm...where to pick? Does it make sense to pick a number in your own timezone? Or should I pick a number &quot;close&quot; to some clients in Chicago or Northeast Ohio? When looking at SIPPhone, I was going to get a Silicon Valley number...far cheaper than opening an office down there.</p>
<p>
	Skype&#39;s list of numbers will likely change. The only list is from actually going through the sign up process and copying out the list of numbers, so I&#39;ll update this as I can.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update:</strong> OK, I picked. You can call me at (415) 367-3595 -- a San Francisco number. It will go to voicemail if I don&#39;t pick up, with this great Norwegian lady telling you that I&#39;m not available.</p>
<p>
	I was thinking that I could use the voicemail instead of my cellphone voicemail, but it would mean paying long distance charges to San Fran. Of course, this might still be cheaper than my $8/month voicemail and caller display charges.</p>
<p>
	In my test (I called the number from my cell phone), SkypeIn does Caller ID as well.</p>
