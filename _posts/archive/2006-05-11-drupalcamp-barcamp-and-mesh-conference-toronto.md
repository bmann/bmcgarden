<p>It&#39;s been a busy couple of weeks. My last post was from San Francisco, and I haven&#39;t even finished posting my notes from the Internet Identity Workshop that I was attending down there.</p><p>I&#39;m sitting in the airport waiting to board a flight to Toronto. I&#39;ll be there until next Wednesday, attending not one, not two, but three separate conference/events.</p><p>They are, in order:</p><ul><li>Drupal Camp Toronto</li><li>Bar Camp Toronto</li><li><a href="http://www.meshconference.com">Mesh Conference</a></li></ul><p>For some reason, I waited until the last minute to buy a ticket to Mesh. It turns out that <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy</a> will be joining me there, I&#39;ll be hanging out in the unconference room (check the wiki for updates around that) and looking to connect with some eastern folks that left nice comments on my <a href="/blog/bmann/web-2-0-mesh-conference-in-toronto-announced-may-15th-16th">first post</a> saying I was coming -- like <a href="http://nuvvo.com/about">John Philip Green</a>. See you in a bit, I still need to update my <a href="http://www.43people.com">43 People</a> list.&nbsp;</p><p>And this will be a very Drupal-y time, I think. This post in I<a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=39402&amp;cid=9">T Business.ca says &quot;Everything&#39;s coming up Drupal&quot;</a>. I probably need to debunk that in more detail -- the summary is that only low budget companies are choosing open source.&nbsp;</p>
