<p>I've got 37 comments and over 1,000 page views on my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/910">Zip.ca post</a> (which is nothing but a link to the site -- I haven't used the service myself...and certainly don't plan to after reading all the comments).</p>

<p>After all this time of people posting comments there, <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/910#comment-2971">Meredith, product manager for Zip.ca,</a> posted a response:</p>
<blockquote>
My name is Meredith and I am the product manager for Zip.ca. I noticed a lot of you post anonymously on this blog and I would like to invite you to send me or George, our Customer Service Manager, an email at suggestions@zip.ca. I would like to look into each of your complaints and ensure your concerns things being addressed properly.
</blockquote>

<p>What's the important thing to look for? Well, if you don't give customers an open place to interact with you, to give you feedback, if you force them through automated channels -- they'll look for a place to post feedback anywhere they can, which in this case is my blog post.</p>

<p>The other side: I've had that post up since February of this year. As a company today, especially one that appeals to technology savvy consumers (of which there are increasingly more), you need to monitor all the channels. Subscribe to <a href="http://www.pubsub.com">PubSub</a> search for your name and URL. Search Google for references to your company name or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zip.ca" title="Google search for zip.ca -- oops, my post is #4!">website</a>.</p>

<p>Within an hour of Meredith's post, someone else replied to her:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I must take note that you mentioned that most of us post anonymously. I should point out that even you posted anonymously - which is a double edge in my mind. I'm a zip.ca customer as well. Anyways, I've only been a member a little while (not trial).</p>

<p>I should point out that I am an internet professional and run my own business. One of my peeves about Zip.ca is that no matter how bad a problem is - there isn't anybody I can call on the phone. Email is OK - but most companies never respond or respond slowly with bad information. Unless you have stellar email service, then you need to have phone service.</p>
