<a href="http://hiyaablog.com/2008/10/winters-tale-canadians-economic-climate.html"><img src="http://hiyaablog.com/uploaded_images/canadian-756580.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a><p><a href="http://twitter.com/sherrett">James</a>, <a href="twitter.com/dannyrobinson">Danny</a> and I were down in San Francisco last week on <a href="http://bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs</a> business -- attending a startup / incubator conference. I suppose I'll do a wrap up post on the business blog at some point this week.</p>

<p>Anywho, we had an excellent time, especially when meeting with Canadian ex-pats <a href="http://danaoshiro.com/">Dana Oshiro</a> and <a href="http://www.rebecca-reeve.com/">Rebecca Reeve</a>.</p>

<p>I've been reading <a href="http://hiyaablog.com/">Dana's other blog, hiyaa</a> for some time, and asked her to put us in it. The picture included here is what she came up with. Danny *does* look to be taking an unnatural interest in James' ear...</p>
