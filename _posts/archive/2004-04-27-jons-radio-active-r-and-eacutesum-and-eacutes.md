<p>Any professional whose work is visible on the Net will become part of the conversation that establishes reputation and creates opportunity. The blog is an <i>active r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> that enables you to participate -- by proxy -- in that conversation.</p>

<p>What an active r&eacute;sum&eacute; should include will vary by profession and according to personal inclination. For a musician, a couple of complete tracks from each CD. For a home renovator, photos and write-ups of some completed projects -- and for extra credit, video walkthroughs. For a programmer, links to those of your applications, tools, or specifications that touch the public domain.</p>

<p>Here's the bottom line. What Alf calls "collaborative filtering and recommendation networks" will rival -- and my guess is, largely supplant -- conventional marketing and promotion. But if those networks can't find you, they won't be able to help you.</p>

<p>Do I really need to add anything? Perhaps a few points&#8230;</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
<li>(Your own) Content matters: put your thoughts and ideas on the web, because it's easier to notice them there and people still need <em>you</em> to implement them (well, at least until brain scanning gets perfected).</li>
<li>Make it easy to find you: this goes from activities such as joining online networking sites that make sense for you to making sure that your content is easily visible to search engines.</li>
<li>Participate in the conversation: you have to be very very good to be able to just shout from a mountain top and have people turn and listen. Post on other sites, leave comments, and of course link unto others.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three items will make you part of a larger community, which in turn can (will!) lead to opportunities.</p>
