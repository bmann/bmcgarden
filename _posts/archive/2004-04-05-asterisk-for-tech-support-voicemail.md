<blockquote>I&#8217;d probably be more excited about this if I had to perform day-to-day support anymore, but it&#8217;s still cool: an <a href="http://megaglobal.net/docs/asterisk/html/rtasterisk.html">interface</a> between the <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk VoIP PBX</a> and the <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt">Request Tracker</a> trouble-ticket system.  This would probably be a <em>great</em> way to handle support voicemail in a small tech company.  It&#8217;d be interesting to see what it&#8217;d take to route all support calls through RT; it&#8217;s pretty typical to have support email recorded in RT, so why not &#8220;this message may be recorded to ensure quality service&#8221; calls? <cite><a href="http://scottstuff.net/scott/archives/000159.html">*scottstuff*: Asterisk and Request Tracker</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>Scott continues to churn out new uses and abuses for Asterisk at a prodigious rate.</p>
