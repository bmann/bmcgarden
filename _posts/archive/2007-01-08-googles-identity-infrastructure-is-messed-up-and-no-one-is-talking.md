<p>OK, I&#39;ve talked to several people about this now and everyone is feeling the pain. 2007 means no more free ride for Google. No, they&#39;re not evil....they&#39;ve just seriously messed up their infrastructure to the point that it is utterly broken.</p><p><a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/01/google-and-my-identity-crisis-2.html">Darren</a> describes the situation quite well. I know that <a href="http://henshaw.org/">Jeff</a> has the same issues, with an extra fun one trying to connect to people with Google Talk. Both Jeff and I have talked to people we know inside Google, but they haven&#39;t been able to find anyone on the &quot;inside&quot; who knows more.</p><p>Here&#39;s my screenshot (extended description on Flickr) of being logged in twice with the same address:</p>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/305078296/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/112/305078296_c28d279202.jpg" alt="Google is screwing up identity" width="500" height="170" /></a>  <p>Public acknowledgement of the broken-ness? Not that I can find. Response to &quot;regular&quot; channels? i.e. this is critical and I can&#39;t use Docs/Spreadsheet? None.</p><p>Google, what&#39;s the plan? I&#39;m not asking to switch to OpenID or allow OpenID logins or any sort of *crazy* talk like that...I just want your existing identity structure to work, to allow me to combine or retire accounts as needed, and not have everything be broken.</p><p>Be nice to have a name or pointer to the person/team that is working on this...there are many people willing to troubleshoot and work on this.&nbsp;</p>
