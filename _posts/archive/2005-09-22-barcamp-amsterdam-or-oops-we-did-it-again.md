<p>The Drupal community was in the process of organizing a meet up around <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">O'Reilly's EuroOSCON event</a> when we heard the bad news: since this is O'Reilly's first OSCON event in Europe, they had limited space and wouldn't have an exhibit hall, and hence wouldn't have room for booths from open source projects. <a href="http://www.drupal4hu.com">KÃ¡roly N&eacute;gyesi</a> is giving a talk, but we would have no booth to man, making it hard to meet a lot of the interesting people that are going to be there.</p>  <p>We were somewhat dejected, but then we had An Idea: why not do our own event, and invite other open source projects to come along. Hmmm...what did this sound like? It sounds like <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a>. So, please join us in helping to organize/attend/promote <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a>*.<br /></p>  <p><img alt="BarCamp Amsterdam" src="/system/files?file=images/drupal//45504215_d5de0a690e.jpg" /></p>  <p><a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/09/22/bar-camp-amsterdam/">Messina</a>, patron saint of BarCamps everywhere, has <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/09/22/bar-camp-amsterdam/">posted about this as well</a> -- so we're off to the races!</p>  <p>* I wanted to call it HamsterCamp...after all, we've got a <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">Moose Camp</a></p> <!--break-->
