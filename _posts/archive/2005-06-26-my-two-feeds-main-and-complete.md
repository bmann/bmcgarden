Just a quick note: I actually have two main feeds on this blog (as well as per-category feeds).

The "main" feed is everything that makes it to the front page, and can be found <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/feed">here</a>.

The "complete" feed is pretty close to everything that I post that is a blog (yeah, I'm not going to get into it, it's just a b-word vs. larger platform thing again), and can be found <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/feed">here</a>. It includes items that I don't promote to the front page.

Basically, the front page main feed is "stuff that Boris thinks everyone should read/is interested in". The stuff I don't promote to the front page is...well, something that I don't feel compelled to pester absolutely everyone about. Like my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1494">Gnomedex rumours</a>. I might even put boring site notices off the front page. Except for this one, since then you'd <strong>never</strong> know what you're missing.

Of course, front pages are dead in any case, so your mileage may vary. We now return you to our regularly scheduled programming.
