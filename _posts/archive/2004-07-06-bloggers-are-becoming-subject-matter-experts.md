Bloggers are becoming subject matter experts, and should the story I was interviewed for run soon, I'm sure the companies mentioned, both pro and con, will know that.. Not only with their service, but with how they care and feed all the press. Bloggers and webcasters included.

<p>I'd like to turn the title around and say "subject matter experts are becoming recognized through their blogs". I'm a subject matter expert first, and someone that maintains a blog second. This kind of personal publishing lets individuals have a similar (if not better) reach online than traditional media.</p>
