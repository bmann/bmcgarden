<p>The <a href="http://ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a> universe features a new picture on the front page, with a credit to me.</p>

<p>This was from Eric's visit up to Vancouver as part of his podcasting and video blogging roadshow, and was actually taken with <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland's</a> camera.</p>

<p>If you want to see a real photographer, check out <A href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris Krug's</a> pictures. And, he won the <a href="http://photos.linux.hp.com/">HP OSCON 2005</a> photo contest, of course -- Rhonda has it covered over on <a href="http://www.staticphotography.com/node/53">Static Photography</a>.</p>

<p>I think I might also start using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/31078933/">this picture</a> as my new icon. I'm not opening it for discussion -- I'll leave that up to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/001147.html">Lee Lefever</a>.</p>
