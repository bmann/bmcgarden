<p>Want to know <a href="http://www.mostlygeek.com/2006/04/04/the-state-of-real-estate-and-the-web-in-canada/">State of Real Estate and the Web in Canada</a>? Just read Ben Wong&#39;s stuff over at Mostly Geek:</p>  <blockquote> We&rsquo;re deep in web2.0 and data is flying everywhere. However, real estate listings in Canada are pretty much still stuck in web1.0. When I read stories about listing aggregators like Zillow.com with millions of listings in the US, I can&rsquo;t help but let out a long *sigh* about the state of things in Canada. </blockquote>  <p>I worked with Ben on some projects at <a href="http://www.sutton.com">Sutton Group</a>. I got a chance to break my head around the many nuances of the real estate business. Just when I thought I understood everything and the various business and regulatory aspects, there would be another layer, I&#39;d swear a lot, and throw out my design for open real estate data.</p>  <p>This is part one from Ben, where he&#39;s going to walk us through the issues around the real estate data walled garden issue in Canada. Remember, this *is* a tipping point kind of thing. Right now, virtually all the value is inside the walled garden silo, with very little information sitting in the &quot;open&quot; silo. But, as the open silo grows, it accrues value a lot more quickly than the walled garden ever can, and there will come a tipping point. Really, the only way to prevent complete open-ness is for the walled garden itself to take steps to become more open.</p>  <p>Open real estate data. It&#39;s an interesting technology concept, but there is *so much* about the real estate business that really is about people. I&#39;ll perhaps write some anecdotal stories about this as Ben continues his series.</p>
