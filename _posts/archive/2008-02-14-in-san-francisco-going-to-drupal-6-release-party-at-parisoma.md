<p>I've been in SF all week on short notice -- client meetings, training, etc. Friday evening is open, and I'm going to join <a href="http://drupal.org/user/18703">Kieran</a> at the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/8903">Drupal 6 release party</a> (<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/429198/">upcoming</a>) being held at <a href="http://parisoma.wordpress.com/">PariSoMa</a> (a cool coworking space, apparently).</p>

<p>Don't wanna talk Drupal? That's fine, I'm up for DiSo, identity, Jabber, startups, whatever. I'll be in the one in the cowboy shirt holding a beer :P</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">Drupal 6 got released</a>. It's going to be great. I'm stoked about working on some mega OpenID infrastructure.</p>
