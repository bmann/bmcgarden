Hey <a href="http://andrewjones.zerendipity.com" title="Andrew Jones Zerendipity Profile">Andrew</a>, you started <a title="Andrew Jones Blog" href="http://www.andrewnoeljones.com">writing a blog</a>, but didn't tell anyone!

I only found out because I was doing some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=zerendipity&btnG=Google+Search">Google searches</a> and your site came up.

Well, I added you to my local <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/bundle/29" title="Boris Mann Consulting - Friends Blog Bundle">Friends bundle</a>, so I'll be keeping an eye on you. My only comment so far: more posting, less pontificating. Here's a smiley to take the sting out of that :wink:
