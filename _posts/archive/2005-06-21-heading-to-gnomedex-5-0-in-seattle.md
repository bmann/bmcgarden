I'd say something witty like "light blogging ahead" (are those sorts of sayings really necessary?), but such has been the case for weeks.

I'm heading to <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> with the <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> Vancouver crew. I probably won't post much during the event -- I tend to do better responding "live". You can catch all the related content over at <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris's</a> <a href="http://www.eventblogging.com/aggregator/gnomedex">Gnomedex Aggregator</a>.

I'm really looking forward to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/001095.html">The Fever's BBQ</a>. If anyone wants to virtually attend the BBQ, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> and I will bring our iSight cameras and you can attend via iChat.
