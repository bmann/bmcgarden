<p><a href="http://www.nitobi.com"><img src="http://www.nitobi.com/nitobilogo.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></a></p>  <p>Congrats to Andre and the gang, formerly known as E-business Apps, now known as <a href="http://www.nitobi.com" title="Nitobi - built for people - AJAX components">Nitobi</a>. <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/alexei/?p=24">Alexei has a write up</a>, including the background on the name.</p>  <p>Rebranding is a tricky business...I teased EBA mercilessly about their name previously (EBusiness Application -- a hyper generic name, with the short form of EBA being only marginally better). I like the new name and logo, now begins the task of making it clear that Nitobi makes some of the best commercial AJAX components in the business. And they&#39;re dabbling with Flex/Flash now as well. Oh, and they&#39;ve become prolific bloggers and BarCamp attendees in the past year or so that I&#39;ve known them, and are all wicked skiiers.</p>  <p>Again, congrats on the renaming process (a 6 letter domain name even!) and good luck...looking forward to lots more news from you all.</p>
