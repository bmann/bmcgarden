<p>I continually get asked for recommendations for developers who can do Android development here in Vancouver.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://nitobi.com">Nitobi team</a>, who are development experts across all platforms, and also the brains behind the cross-platform <a href="http://phonegap.com">Phonegap</a> project. But, they tend to be busy with global clients.</p>
<p>So, if you're an Android developer, please fill out the form below. Once I've got a couple of listings, I'll put together a public directory of local Android freelancers and development shops.</p>
