<p>I went shopping along Main Street this past Saturday. All the cool indie fashion designers in Vancouver have shops along Main and/or stores that carry their designs. The one purchase I ended up making was this skull jacket. It's made by Process Clothing, and I bought it at <a href="http://www.devil-may-wear.com">Devil May Wear</a>. The guy takes thrift / vintage jackets and then does embroidery of different designs. This one is actual a wool "Harris Tweed" from Scotland. I like the skulls (pirates!) and it fit me perfectly. It's nice to have something unique. Other designs were an image of a spine along the back, and some jazz trumpet player scenes.</p>

<p>He also makes t-shirts. Definitely something I'll be looking to get more of. One of these days I should probably get some more business attire rather than just funky / casual stuff :P</p>
