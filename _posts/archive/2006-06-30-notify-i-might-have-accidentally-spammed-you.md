<p>So, I just turned on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/notify">notify</a> module here on my site. I noticed that *I* just got a massive email sent to me from the site with lots of posts in it. Err..I may have spammed everyone with an account on this site.</p><p>If you *don&#39;t* want to get email every week with any of my new posts, you can login, and go to the <a href="/user">my account</a> link, then hit the &quot;my notify settings&quot; link.</p>  <p>So, if you got a big long email from this site...sorry for the spam!</p>
