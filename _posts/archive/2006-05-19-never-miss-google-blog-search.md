<p>So, uh, until Google posted <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/never-browse-outdated-posts-again.html">Never browse outdated posts again</a>, I forgot they even *had* blog search...</p>  <p>I still use <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> for &quot;instant&quot; blog search, and all my future search feeds are using <a href="http://www.pubsub.com">PubSub</a>.</p>
