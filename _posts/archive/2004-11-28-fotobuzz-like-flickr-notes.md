<p>The <a href="http://www.2entwine.com/" title="Flash- and Jabber-based cross platform IM, photo sharing, and RSS reading application">Gush</a> developers have created something very similar to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr's</a> notes capability:</p>

<blockquote>
We've released a web utility called FotoBuzz which allows you to annotate JPEGs using Flash on the client side and PHP/Python on the server-side. It's dirt easy to integrate into existing webpages. After including some CSS and JavaScript in the HTML head, all you have to do is add a single attribute to the image tag and it will do the rest for you.

<p><em>Of course</em> I have to think about putting this into Drupal somehow. Along with integrating Flickr directly (<a href="http://www.jluster.org">Jonas</a> -- get off your ass and release that code!), this should do nicely.</p>
