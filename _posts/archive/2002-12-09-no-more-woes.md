I was <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node.php?id=22">quite frustrated</a> with the server box that I have.

First, installing an 80GB drive to hold our MP3s was a trial:
<ul><li>Fiddle with jumpers on hard drives</li><li>Motherboard BIOS doesn't recognize 80GB</li><li>Figure out MB brand and current BIOS version</li><li>Download flash updater and new BIOS</li><li>Find floppy drive to install with</li><li>Find OS to make <a href="http://www.bootdisk.com/">bootable floppy</a> (that link was a lifesaver)</li><li>Flash BIOS</li><li><strong>Drive recognized!</strong></li></ul>After that, and finally settling back on <a href="http://www.e-smith.org">e-smith</a> as my Linux distro of choice (it seems like I mention it almost every post...it really is that good), it was just a matter of loading files.

I'm using <a href="http://netjuke.sourceforge.net">NetJuke</a> to manage the MP3s. Basically, all files are on disc, but the data is stored in a database. Tools included for scanning various file directories. If you want access, email me and I'll send you a password.

The only bad thing is that the fan on the server currently sounds like a jet turbine, which may be a problem seeing as how this will be Kate and mine's temporary bedroom while her mom visits.
