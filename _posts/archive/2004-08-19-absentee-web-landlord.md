So, another change, and back to more posting. The website is somewhere stable and fast (finally!). It's been upgraded to the newest version of Drupal, which basically means a bunch of stuff is broken, but there are some good new features coming.

Excuses? Yep, I got plenty of 'em. Work has been keeping me very busy the past two weeks (<a href="http://www.sutton.com" title="Canadian Real Estate">here</a>, <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com" title="Purveyors of fine Blogware Solutions">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bryght.com" title="Bryght - Community Content Hosting (and my soon-to-be-launched startup)">here</a>) and before that <a href="http://wedding.bmannconsulting.com">I got married</a>.

And finally, the technical excuse. The el-cheapo dedicated server box in a Texas datacenter that I invested in simply didn't have enough juice to keep up.

Use the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/add/forum/126">BMC feedback forum</a> if you want to point out any broken-ness. This whole site will go through (yet another) revamp. I need to re-integrate <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com">my personal life</a>.
