<a href="http://vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is likely to release the final version of its softphone for OS-X next week. I have been using a beta version of the <a href="http://www.xten.com/">X-Ten</a> Pro software which apparently has been customized for Vonage by X-Ten Networks. If the customized version is anything like the one I have been using, Mac users are going to love it.

<p>Somehow, I doubt Mac users are going to love it. Maybe on Windows users are accustomed to this type of interface, but&#8230;</p>

<p>X-Ten is a great company -- leading VoIP softphone, commitment to open standards, and they're even a good, local Vancouver company. But their interface is <em>terrible</em>. The interface isn't native on any platform that I've seen it on, the preference screens are hidden in the same terrible "we're trying to make it look like a phone" graphics, and it's gigantic!</p>

<p>Please, hire some interface designers and re-do the entire interface. Think clean, minimalist, and platform native. Heck, it's a voice application -- all I really need is a taskbar icon.</p>
