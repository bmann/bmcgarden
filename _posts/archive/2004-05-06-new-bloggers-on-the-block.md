<p>I wanted to point out two colleagues of mine that recently started blogging. Actually, they started today, with a little help from the company I work for, <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com" title="Streamline Web Co - Vancouver based blog consulting and community platforms">Streamline Web Co</a>.</p>

<p>So, say hello to <a href="http://stewartmarshall.blogware.com">Stewart Marshall</a> and <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy Angrignon</a>. We hooked both of them up with personal <a href="http://www.blogware.com">Blogware</a> blogs (you can have your own free <a href="http://blogstore.streamlinewebco.com/">30-day trial</a>). Read on for a little more about these two.</p>

<p>I met Stewart (in person) at the <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/view/77">Vancouver portion of the Canadian Ecademy Roadshow</a>. By the time myself and <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> had met with Stewart a second time, we had him drinking the blogging Kool-Aid. He's heading back to England for now, but he and his wife <a href="http://www.moosehat.com">Jessica</a> are going to be back as permanent Vancouver-area residents (it looks like North Vancouver is the first choice right now).</p>

<p>Next up is Troy. Now I can stop having my inbox clogged up with cool links and ideas and just go read about them on his blog instead. His first post is entitled <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/6/52670.html">Big Questions, Long Views, and the Intersection of Technology and Society</a> and serves as an intro to the kind of things Troy will be writing about. I actually think that that title would actually make a good tagline for his blog.</p>

<p>Here's the last paragraph from his post:</p>
<blockquote>
Finally! I now have somewhere to put all of my random thoughts in order to cross-link some more synaptic connections. That's one of the great joys of reflection and writing. I wish I could remember the author who said, "I do not write what I know, I write so that I may know myself." That was very wise. That is also a goal of this blog. Thanks for reading. (Hello? Hello?)
</blockquote>

<p>Now go leave <a href="http://stewartmarshall.blogware.com">Stewart</a> and <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com">Troy</a> a comment.</p>
