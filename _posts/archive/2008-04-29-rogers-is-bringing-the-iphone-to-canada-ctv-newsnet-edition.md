<p>Looks like I'll be on <a href="http://www.ctv.ca">CTV Newsnet</a> at 12:15pm today, talking about <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080429/rogers_iphone_080429/20080429/">Rogers bringing the iPhone to Canada</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the funny thing here is that there are many many people in Canada who already have the iPhone, in its "unlocked" edition. <a href="http://johnbiehler.com/category/iphone/">John Biehler's iPhone category</a> is my source for all the latest in unlocking and cool applications.</p>

<p>The rumour seems to think that part of the delay and secrecy is because of the possibility that we might get the "new" version of the iPhone, with 3G (which is a faster data network connection). The other rumours about the new model (or models? maybe a "business" version to compete with RIM's BlackBerry?) are things like a much upgraded camera, or even a front mounted camera for video calling.</p>

<p>I'm genuinely happy that we're getting the iPhone "for real" in Canada, but I'm worried about a) the price of the contract and b) the length of any contract from Rogers. We're in a monopoly situation here, since there aren't any other GSM providers in Canada. Expect Telus and Bell to start heavily pushing the HTC Touch and various consumer BlackBerry devices like the Pearl.</p>
