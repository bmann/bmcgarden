The <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/print_article/0,3998,a=39991,00.asp">full article</a> has a nice run down of everything you need, including a components list and step by step instructions. This is for making that box that is connected to your TV and runs all your multimedia systems.

From the article, it sounds like the <a href="http://freevo.sourceforge.net/">Freevo</a> project has come a long way.

I still don't know that I'd want to run all my web-based, server-type items on the same box -- it's just such a pain versus <a href="http://www.e-smith.org">e-smith</a>. Speaking of which, I've got a server upgrade to v5.6 somewhen in my future.
