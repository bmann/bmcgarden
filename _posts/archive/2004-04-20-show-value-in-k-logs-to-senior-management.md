<p>There are some good concepts coming from the personal publishing and social software world that need to be applied to corporate knowledge management and sharing. I think many of the same values hold true, it's just that the tools are easier to use and the social software aspect has been increased. In all, I think this means that knowledge sharing projects (and cultures!) are more likely to succeed. More likely to succeed == better ROI == more organizations sharing knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>I would like to take this issue and turn it into a seed question. "What would be common ways to convince management to use lightweight, social collaboration tools for knowledge management?"
