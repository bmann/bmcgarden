<p>Hey <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2005/06/family_oriented.html">Marc</a>, your calculations are correct. I will be back from <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/open-source-in-stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> in time for dim sum. Maybe <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie</a> wants to come too, and we can go hang out at Stanley Park afterwards.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of micro-content. Drupal has enabled this for years, since it's not &quot;just&quot; a blogging tool. Ideally, formats/standards will arise organically. It's fairly trivial to export a different structured format if the source information is stored in a database. I don't really care much about the h* formats...specialized outputs will either be supported directly by themes, or styled as appropriate by people using them.</p>

<p>Drupal's current <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/event">event module</a> outputs iCal feeds. I think we're going to add per-item vCal links, as well as maybe an RSS feed with vCal items in the enclosure field. There is an RDF <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/">namespace for events</a> that might be useful as well, but by supporting iCal and vCal, you get support for the majority of platforms/users without having to rely on support in the client news aggregator -- the default actions of the local OS take over.</p>
