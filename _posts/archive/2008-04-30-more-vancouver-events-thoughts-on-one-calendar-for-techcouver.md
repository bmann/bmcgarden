<p>First up, I'm going to do the call out of upcoming Vancouver events:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday, April 30th (tonight!) is <a href="http://blog.tazzu.com/2008/04/10/tazzu-wordpress-camp-in-vancouver/">WordPress Camp</a>, put on by the folks at <a href="http://tazzu.com">Tazzu</a> - I've got <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com">Dad</a> night every other Wednesday so I won't be making it this time. Maybe someone should set up a Vancouver WordPress Users Group and do this regularly? VanWUG!</li>
<li>May 9th and 10th is <a href="http://drupalcampvancouver.org/">DrupalCamp Vancouver</a> - I'll be talking about install profiles and likely a "getting started with Drupal" talk where I go through all the core modules; more on this in a full post</li>
<li></li>
<li>early June date TBD <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver07">DemoCampVancouver07</a> - back to the "regular" format of 30 second pitches and voting on stage for full talks; maybe we'll do this right after the F&F event</li>
</ul>

<p>Check <a href="http://www.miss604.com/2008/04/vancouver-social-media-scene-wordcamp-drupalcamp-netsquared-launch-party-4.html">Miss 604</a> for another recent event round up.</p>

<p>In general, I'll mostly be doing full descriptions of events that I'm hosting / help organize around startups will be over at the <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com" title="Vancouver startup incubator">Bootup Labs blog</a>. Coming soon there is a Vancouver <a href="http://foundersandfunders.org">Founders and Funders</a> in June after the Toronto event.</p>

<p>OK, on to the topic of "one calendar". Or rather, a consolidated calendar. There really are a lot of events going on in Vancouver, and it's hard to schedule new ones, it's hard to get a central overview of them, and it's hard / annoying to cross post Upcoming / Facebook / wikis / etc. Several people coming to DemoCampVancouver have said something along the lines of "I'm new in town, how do I find out about more events". Answers like "read these 10 peoples' blogs isn't really a solution.</p>

<p>I had lunch with Rob Lewis from <a href="http://www.techvibes.com">TechVibes</a> the other week. TechVibes continues to work on re-vamping their site (they'll be going through a major re-tooling over the summer) and we came around to the subject of events.</p>

<p>TechVibes has an events calendar, but it's painful. Yeah, they know it :P We talked about adding value there, specifically getting the community involved and providing something of value that the wider community could get involved with and rally around (e.g. not a TechVibes direct "property" per se).</p>

<p>I came up with two concepts.</p>

<p>One is for TechVibes to enable cross posting from TechVibes to <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com">Upcoming</a> and other sites (Facebook? can anything post an event to Facebook using the API?). Post in one spot, get cross posting goodness "for free", which sounds like a good reason to post to TechVibes for those of us organizing and promoting events.</p>

<p>In general, I'm a fan of Upcoming. As <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com">Brendon</a> said, it's great to use in San Francisco, since it's got full coverage of everything from tech events to arts. Here in Vancouver, coverage is a little spotty. I try and enter everything there because it is on the public web with a permalink (as opposed to Facebook...).</p>

<p>The second concept is around <a href="http://www.techcouver.com">TechCouver</a>. <a href="http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/News/2008/04/23/5362326-sun.html">Buzz Bishop is leading the media charge to make this another Vancouver nickname</a> - and that's great. So let's make TechCouver a local aggregator of tech-related blog posts and events.</p>

<p>The map is great as well, and we could use both. Basically, have tech companies and bloggers enter a listing for themselves including an RSS feed. We aggregate all the feeds, and run our own TechMeme for Vancouver. Well, minus the secret algorithm -- I'd like to do voting so we can see "best of" posts as well as the "river of news" of recent stuff.</p>

<p>So, one central spot for tech related postings and events, one central spot we can direct people to, to find out what's happening in TechCouver.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is this interesting? Useful to you? Would you visit it? Would you subscribe to it and/or use the OPML file it would generate? Let's use this <a href="http://www.techcouver.com">TechCouver wiki page</a> to discuss features and such, or comment here.</p>
