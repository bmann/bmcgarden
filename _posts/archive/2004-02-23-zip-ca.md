Dave <a href="http://www.smithdm3.com/archives/000225.html" title="Dave Smith on Zip.ca's DVD Rental Service">wrote about Zip.ca</a>, a DVD rental-by-mail service patterned after Netflix, but based in Canada. Actually, I believe they are actually in Ottawa. $24.95 per month, up to 3 movies out at one time. Means you would have to rent about 6 movies per month to make it worthwhile.
