<p>I'm relaxing on Bowen for a couple of days and thinking about some fun little projects that I might be able to do. One idea I had was to get a list of in season produce for the Vancouver area, and then combine that list with pictures from Flickr and recipes to make a cool calendar. I wrote up what I found so far on my <a href="http://foodlikethat.com/blog/boris-mann/figuring-out-whats-season-when-vancouver">FoodLikeThat blog</a>.</p>

<p>My funny joke is that meat, of course, is ALWAYS in season :P</p>

<p>Oh, and yes, I have been doing a ton of Christmas cooking, so I posted a <a href="http://foodlikethat.com/blog/boris-mann/christmas-season-cooking-time">partial list of what's been cooked so far</a>.</p>
