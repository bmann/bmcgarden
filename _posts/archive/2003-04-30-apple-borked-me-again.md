So the new power supply I bought, it's borked. The glow ring that says "you are charging/ your battery is full" is always glowing green; well, unless I unplug the thing.
Is this covered by warranty <s>Greg</s> Graham?

( breaking B's rules of continuity by posting here but <s>Greg</s> Graham prolly reads this site more than mine )
