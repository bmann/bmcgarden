<p>All in all, it's a good product, but all these people talking about how 30mm people are going to switch over to it must be seeing something I don't.  My prediction (and I'll happily and publicly acknowledge defeat if I am misreading this) is that they will get a few million new users initially, many for a second or third address as opposed to their primary address, and that many of them won't stick with it to become active users over a longer period of time.  After that, they'll grow at the same rate, with the same type of characteristics, as Yahoo, Hotmail, and other webmail providers.</p>

<p>Email and email addresses, unlike search engines, are pretty sticky things.</p>

<p>I archive my email locally because I have to -- my mail servers aren't big enough, and my webmail access doesn't include search. If Google offered me Gmail <em>plus</em> access via IMAP, I'd pay for it. Just like I'd <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1184">love to pay Flickr to handle all my online photo sharing</a>.</p>

<p>I agree that email is very sticky. I'd love to convince everyone that doesn't already have their own domain to get one.</p>

<p>When Gmail becomes widely availably, I'm going to lobby very, very hard to all my friends that currently have Hotmail accounts to switch. I know Hotmail doesn't do forwarding, and it likely doesn't have a vacation message/auto-reply. Can anyone think of a way to forward your Hotmail automatically?</p>
