Six months ago I sat Bob Mimeault&#160;of <a href="http://www.versatelnetworks.com/">Versatel Networks</a> down in a restaurant and told him that I was working on a startup.&#160;Bob was terrific.&#160; He&#160;told me that he&#160;still needed me,&#160;but&#160;also&#160;committed to help me get my company started.&#160;Today was my last day as Versatel's marketing VP.&#160;Tomorrow is my first day full time as the CEO of Iotum Corporation, a VoIP startup.

<p>Alec joined my LinkedIn network quite some time back while I was still in Ottawa, but I was in the midst of getting myself moved back out to Vancouver and never had a chance to meet him in person. Is <a href="http://www.iotum.com/">this</a> where Iotum will live? I'm keeping my eye out...</p>
