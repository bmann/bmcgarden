<p>The Vancouver PHP Conference 2007 is coming up next week. I think registration is full or close to it. We&#39;ve got <a href="http://acko.net">Steven</a> and <a href="http://walkah.net">James</a> giving a couple of talks on Drupal and Identity / OpenID.</p><p>There is also a (free, as in beer) <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/osspanel2007">panel on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) on Monday night</a>. It&#39;s open to the public and sponsored by a group called <a href="http://ictcoop.ca/">Information and Communications Technology / Open Source Co-op</a>. Never heard of &#39;em, but they run Drupal, so they can&#39;t be all bad :P</p><p>Some of the topics up for discussion include:</p><ul><li>Choosing a license</li><li>GPL3</li><li>Common Misperceptions about the GPL</li><li>Growth in GPL</li><li>Winning Over New Converts to FOSS</li><li>Reasons Why Businesses Choose FOSS</li><li>Current state of FOSS in North America</li><li>Encouraging the growth of FOSS in Vancouver/N. America</li></ul><p>Well, there&#39;s a selection of things I&#39;m passionate about :P Should be interesting to see how the discussion goes, but I suspect it will be preaching to the converted in many cases. </p>
