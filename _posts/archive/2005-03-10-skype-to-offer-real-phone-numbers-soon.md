<p>While <a href="http://www.duanestorey.com">Duane</a> and <a href="http://www.muddylaces.ca">Greg</a> have been <a href="/node/1438" title="The best days of VoIP are yet to come">contributing to the discussion</a> about how we are going to see a lot in the standards-based SIP world soon, Skype keeps rolling out features.</p>

<p>Andy Abramson got alerted to some interesting sections in Skype's help docs, which seem to suggest that Skype will be offering virtual numbers very soon:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://support.skype.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&_j=questiondetails&_i=269">Skype's Help</a> section can be a plethora of information. A loyal reader in the UK sent along a note about SkypeIN. While I have yet to verify that In is Out, certainly the details are emerging. Do a little noodling around Skype's help and see what I mean.

<p>I've set up a <a href="http://www.sipphone.com">SIPPhone</a> account, but haven't gotten around to a) configuring it on a free client or b) buying a virtual number. Actually, since I didn't buy any software or hardware from SIPPhone, there seems to be a bug: I can't buy a virtual number!</p>

<p>In any case, Skype is running on my desktop all the time. I would absolutely pay $5US/month for a virtual number plus voicemail.</p>

<p>It is no longer (or perhaps never?) about technology: it's marketing. Skype has an excellent, highly usably product with an excellent GUI sitting on desktops around the world. It's not getting any better with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/fraserspeirs/843257.html">some people saying Apple should hook up with Skype</a>. SIP needs a very large champion to overcome this advantage.</p>
