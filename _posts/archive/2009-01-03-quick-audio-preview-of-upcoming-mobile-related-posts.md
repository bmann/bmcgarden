<p>Here's a quick audio preview of content for upcoming posts, that I&nbsp;recorded on a brand new <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41146122">Nokia E71</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'm OK with 3 year cell phone contracts here in Canada (this is going to be a post)</li>
    <li>I like the E71 (this will be another post)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.hopstudios.com/nep/unvarnished/item/rogers_wireless_is_the_devil.html" title="According to Travis">Rogers is the devil</a>, Fido is the anti christ (and for hipsters)</li>
    <li>&quot;They do have dogs, which is why I signed up for them in the first place&quot; - <a href="http://www.financialstoryteller.com/">Stewart Marshall</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/360398/Stewart_nokiae71_teaser.mp3">audio file</a>. <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com/">My dad</a> is heading back to Spain for another walk along the Camino, so he's learning his way around the E71 in wifi only mode, while I'm still on the Nokia N78, except now with a data plan. I need to also do a final review post of the N78.</p>
