	I was working on my <a href="/node/620">resume</a> today when I had a couple of ideas that might be worth following up on.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>
	The first was about XML resumes: it&#39;s actually faster for me to nicely format my resume in XHTML (with a stylesheet) rather than fighting with MS Word or some other program. Some quick searching turned up a handful of good options, which are links organized underneath this page.</p>
<p>
	The second idea is about resume promotion. This kind of ties in to Search Engine Optimization (a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=boris+mann&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">search for my name</a> has my main website first, and my resume second) and a bunch of blog promotion advertising stuff. Well, or advertising in general.</p>
<p>
	What if, just like <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Ads</a> or <a href="http://blogsnob.simpleads.net/">Blogsnob</a>, you could &quot;advertise&quot; your resume all over the place? I&#39;m not clear on the entire structure, but essentially you could push your resume to relevant content all over the place.</p>
<p>
	There&#39;s a tie-in to social software here, as well. You could certainly link to/list friends, previous managers, previous companies, etc. A site like <strong>PromoteMyResume.com</strong> could be used as a central directory or search tool, and you could also link in external stuff. Hmmm...filter by &quot;previously employed by company X&quot; and other stuff like that.</p>
