Woo hoo... This <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2130826,00.html"> article </a> goes into how Intel is trying to replace the ages old BIOS in your machine to something they call Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI).  This would allow component/board manufacturers to program extensions not in assembly... but rather in C... excellent.  The coolest part in my mind (at least from reading the article) is the "afterlife" ability it could provide!  Neato!
