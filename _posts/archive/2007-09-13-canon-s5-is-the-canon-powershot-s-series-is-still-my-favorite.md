<p><a href="http://www.iworkindustries.com">James</a> and I originally set out on Saturday to both buy a <a href="http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0665000FS10089228&catid=11719">Canon S5 IS at Future Shop</a>, but they were out and gave us rain checks. Here's a link to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/powershot_s5_is">Flickr's page about the S5 IS</a> -- there are some amazing photos there.</p>

<p>I've been a long time fan of the S series. I bought the S1 IS three years ago, and have been raving about it ever since: big zoom, great movie mode, really good optics, regular rechargeable AA batteries. I've taken most of the 7000 pictures on my Flickr account with the S1 IS. But, I recently dropped the camera and it's been acting up.</p>

<p>Luckily, Canon has continued to evolve the series. I've continued to recommend the series, and pretty much everyone I know that has bought one has been happy with it. About the *only* downside is its size: it's too big to be a pocket cam. But, I've always been happy with this trade off -- increasingly, my cellphone has been taking the role of pocket cam, and if I am going somewhere where I want really great pictures, I'll take the camera along.</p>

<p>So I ended up going to London Drugs this evening and bought the Canon S5 IS ... it's on for $499 there, but they'll price match Future Shop at $479. I went to the store on West Broadway -- Harry C was behind the counter and super knowledgeable. A 4GB SD card for $69 completed the purchase (and I just remembered that I forgot to get a UV filter -- recommended even just as a way to keep your main lens from scratching). First photo at right. Not super exciting, I know, but 8MP rather than the 3.2MP that I've been used to, and *excellent* low light performance.</p>

<p>In short, I still love the Canon PowerShot S series, and continue to recommend it to anyone that doesn't want a pocket cam. </p>

<p>You should buy this camera if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>a really big zoom (technically the ultrazoom category) -- the S5 is 12x optical</li>
<li>great macro modes -- the S5 actually has a 0cm "super macro" -- yes, you can actually put the lens directly on the thing you want to take a picture of (check out these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10596914@N05/1191068197"/>macro shots of lemons on Flickr</a> that were taken with the S5)</li>
<li>regular AA batteries -- esp. important when travelling</li>
<li>excellent movie quality, including sound -- 640x480 at 30fps, with stereo audio recording; oh yeah, and it actually has built in audio levels and even a wind filter</li>
<li>a rotating LCD screen -- from self portraits to crowd shots, I've been addicted</li>
<li>a viewfinder -- I actually take most of my pics through the viewfinder, which also saves batteries; the viewfinder just gives me more of a, well, professional feel, I guess</li>
<li>consistently good pictures -- there's not much fiddling to be done here, although you do have access to a lot of programmability</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not buy this camera if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>something that fits in your pocket -- this is way smaller than an SLR, but it's not jean pocket sized</li>
<li>RAW support -- well, this really is high end camera stuff</li>
<li>an SLR -- while this is perfect for me, who just isn't going to add high end photography and lenses etc. etc. to stuff that I do, this is not a Digital SLR; it just happens to be a very good "prosumer" digital camera</li>
</ul>
