<p>Flat rate mobile broadband? 3 Group in the UK just <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/news/h3gnews/pressnewsview.omp?collcid=1019745742912&amp;cid=1163170230108&amp;index=1">announced their &quot;X-Series&quot;</a> -- flat-rate broadband Internet access on their mobile phones, with interesting tie ins with everyone from Google to Sling boxes to Orb.</p><p>I saw this a couple of different places, and agree with <a href="http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2006/11/20/2514502.html">Troy</a> -- I also hope that this &quot;will drive a chain reaction and like the Berlin wall, this would cause flat-rate pricing and open gardens to flourish across the planet, creating a massive open platform upon which innovation would explode across the 2 billion phones currently on the planet.&quot;</p><p>At the same time, I spent some time today looking at a mobile service that still includes WAP and really simple services. This is a huge addressable market, but it doesn&#39;t seem as interesting as some of the &quot;next step&quot; smart platforms that we&#39;re seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, my recent trip to the US saw me paying 95&cent; per minute for roaming charges. Due to my grandfathered Fido plan, my data services the whole way were free. In what universe does this make sense?&nbsp;</p>
