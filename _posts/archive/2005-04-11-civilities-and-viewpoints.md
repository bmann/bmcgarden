<p>I must be slipping. I had never heard of Civilities until <a href="http://www.blogaholics.ca/archives/2005/04/the_blogging_re.html">Arieanna pointed towards it</a>. Jon Garfunkel is doing some amazing writing, and he's hitting all my buttons: it's all about Web 2.0, it's not a blog, and he's using Drupal to power it all:</p>

<blockquote>
Civilities is the work, so far, of one person. One might thus label it a <a href="http://civilities.net/OnBlogs">blog</a>, but it isn't one. It's better than a blog. I call it a <a href="http://civilities.net/CivDefinition">Civ</a>, which conveniently is an acronym for &quot;Constructing Informative Viewpoints&quot;.<p>
<cite><a href="http://civilities.net/About">Civilities.net: About page</a></cite>
</p></blockquote>
<!--break-->

<p>Next fantastic thing from Jon: <a href="http://civilities.net/ViewPoints">ViewPoints</a>. Alex Samuel and I had a discussion about online consultation -- which we really need to post some ideas around -- and I think Jon's ViewPoints are a step in that direction. Here's what he sees as the Usage Patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Any point of discussion can become a quick poll.
</li><li>A debate may develop between two parties; participants may score each point in the debate as it happened.
</li><li>Meta-moderation works simply by applying ViewPoints to an existing post.</li></ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, Alex is also heading back east soon, so hopefully she will get a chance to sit down and discuss these concepts with Jon directly.</p><p>Tags: <a rel="tag" href="http://alexandrasamuel.com/">alex samuel</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://civilities.net/">jon garfunkel</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/tag/onlineconsultation">online consultation</a></p><p><a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/tag/onlineconsultation"></a></p>

<p>BTW -- these tag things at the bottom of some of my posts are supposed to lure <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> here. My Blog Therapist posts still aren't showing up with their tags, but T. did finally <a href="http://www.technorati.com/profile/borismann">accept my blog claim</a>. I'm choosing specifically to not link to the Technorati tag page, but rather a URL I believe representative of the linked tag. It's still supposed to work, but hasn't for me so far.</p>
