<p>I saw this first <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/09/13/google-rss-search-coming/">via Om</a> -- Google has launched it's own feed-only <a href="http://www.google.com/blogsearch">BlogSearch</a>. Feed-only is important, as <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/09/google_launching_feed_search_t.html">Niall explains</a>:  </p><blockquote>I think feed search is just another type of search restricted to a group of MIME types, as previously stated, and as the types of content made available via a feed continue to grow I think a feed-specific search tool will become much more than just blog search. </blockquote>  <p>Niall also talks about how <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> indexes the entire blog page HTML, not just feed. This is actually less valuable for me -- all I ever get that way are blogroll hits and other irrelevant matches.</p>  <p>In exploring microformats, I actually was checking out Google's support for filetype restrictions. For instance, here is a <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=test+filetype%3Avcf&btnG=Search&meta=">search for the phrase &quot;test&quot;, restricted to vCards</a> (.vcf is the extension). Very interesting...</p>  <p>So, the space continues to evolve. In my TV spot, I demo'd how searches for London Bombing at the time showed results from the 1940's blitz in Google, and realtime results in blog search engines. Google <i>had</i> to respond at some point. This current release is decidedly uninteresting -- the results aren't that great. I do like the hinted-at capabilities of the <a href="http://www.google.com/blogsearch/advanced_blog_search?hl=en">advanced blog search page</a>, but PubSub's <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/booleanhelp.php">boolean operators</a> are already as powerful or more so.  </p><p>Aside: Hey, are PubSub SiteStats new? here are the ones for <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/site_stats.php?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmannconsulting.com">this site</a>.</p>  <p>So, Google, welcome to the community. I'm hoping you'll grow a <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog">Zawodny</a> soon...you're starting to feel a bit big and corporate (translation: it doesn't feel like you're engaging your community)</p>
