Shrook is a desktop RSS aggregator for Mac OS X. As opposed to NetNewsWire, it allows you to keep an online version of your subscriptions available to you through any browser at <a href="http://www.shrook.com">Shrook.com</a>. Your subscriptions are also shareable.

It is shareware that costs $19.95. Something I might consider investing in. Ideally, I would like to synchronize my Drupal and local subscriptions, perhaps by sharing an <a href="http://www.opml.org">OPML</a> file online.
