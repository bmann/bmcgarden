<p>Amongst others, <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007698">A Whole Lotta Nothing</a> pointed out that Apple's latest Bluetooth and iChat updates let you basically use iChat as a VoIP phone.</p>

<p>The news being that the latest version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ichat/download/" title="iChat  AV 2.1 Public Beta Download">iChat</a> will work with AOL clients on the PC side as well. And just after I figured out that I could use <a href="http://fire.sourceforge.net">Fire</a> to log onto AOL with my .Mac username as well.</p>

<p>The Bluetooth angle is very cool. Now you can pair a Bluetooth headset with your Mac, enabling you to use it as an audio source and destination. So, wander around listening to iTunes wirelessly, then use speech control to change songs.</p>

<p>(Yes, Rob Local, this means that if you and I both get webcams, we'll be able to chat)</p>
