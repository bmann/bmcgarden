Freshmeat now has a dedicated section for Mac OS X. Truly a sign of how many *NIX geeks are getting OS X.
<blockquote>
We've had trove nodes for the Mac OS X operating system and the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa frameworks for ages. We've had an OS X package download link for ages. Now we officially have a whole freshmeat section devoted to the next generation of Apple's operating system.
