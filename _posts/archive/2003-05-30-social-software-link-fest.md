Don Park, <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/05/30.html#a540">Chaotic Automagic</a> - quotes yet-another-blog-post from <a href="http://www.nonliteral.com/archives/2003/05/30/wheres_the_love_baby.html">Chuck Lawson</a>, whose contention it is that many of today's networking sites require too much effort. I can see this myself from the number of people in my network with 1 connection. Anyone that I've spent 30min or an hour with, explaining the concept and its benefits, will actively go out and add more to their network.

Don had another cool entry, riffing on the idea of <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/05/29.html#a536">posting multiple types of media to a post</a> -- as comments, as annotations, etc.<blockquote>When I read a blog post that I like, I don't always have something to say.
