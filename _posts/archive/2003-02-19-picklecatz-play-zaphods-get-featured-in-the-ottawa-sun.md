My band (long story -- I don't play an instrument, I help out in various ways, and am known as the "6th Picklecat"), the <a href="http://www.picklecatz.com">Picklecatz</a>, played at Zaphod Beeblebrox's in Ottawa's Byward Market tonight.

They were sounding good, and me and a bunch of the "Picklecatz Ladies" (girlfriends of band members) danced to a couple of songs.

Somehow we even managed to get an article in today's Ottawa Sun. You can <strike><a href="http://www.canoe.ca/OttawaToday/os.os-02-19-0056.html">read the article online</a></strike> (turns out the post gets pulled very soon). Unfortunately, the online version is missing the terrible picture.
