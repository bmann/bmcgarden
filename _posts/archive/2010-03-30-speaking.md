<p>
	I speak &amp; lecture at a variety of conferences and events. If you are interested in having me speak or put together a custom training session, lecture, or workshop, please <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>
	Here is a sample of some of the topics that I generally speak on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Open source: the whats &amp; whys, building community, community ROI, open source and business</li>
	<li>
		Open data: the whats &amp; whys, licensing (this is an emerging space, but one I am increasingly passionate about)</li>
	<li>
		Drupal: community guide, use Drupal modules, architecture &amp; best practices</li>
	<li>
		Web strategy: we used to call it blogging, now it&#39;s called social media - what pieces of emerging technology are affecting your business? what tools can you use? what new social norms are being built and discovered?</li>
	<li>
		Entrepreneurship: web startups: building knowledge worker skills, ecosystems, role of universities &amp; academics</li>
</ul>
