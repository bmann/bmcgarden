My good friend (and former manager at Nortel) <a href="http://www.360wiz.com/blog/">Trevor Jones has a blog</a>.

I've also added him to my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/bundle/29">friends bundle</a>, so you'll see items from him pop into the sidebar on the right from time to time. He's decided to start with <a href="http://www.360wiz.com/blog/item/3">music, and Rush</a>.

I actually gained somewhat of an appreciation for Rush from a bunch of friends/roommates from Sechelt, where the spirit of Rush is apparently still strong. Just checking our music library, it does however appear that I have no Rush songs! Not even on the Bob & Doug Mckenzie album ("take off, to the Great White North, take off!"). Classic...
