<p>[Cross posted from the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/innovation-commons-kick-off">wiki</a>.]</p>  <p>Inspired by such diverse influences as <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/08/26#When:9:21:42PM">Dave Winer's post about this for Silicon Valley</a>, the <a href="http://www.queenstreetcommons.org">Queen Street Commons</a> in Prince Edward Island, and the serendipity of continuously meeting Vancouver's local tech/entreprenuer community at <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com/">Take 5</a> slurping lattes and free wireless, I'm announcing the kick off meeting for organizing Vancouver's Innovation Commons. I'm suggesting <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/events/innovation-commons-brainstorming-session-sep-2005">6:30pm next Wednesday</a>. Steamworks or Raincity Studio's Video Monster are two possible locations, please leave a comment suggesting an alternate.</p>  <p>Right now, I see the concept of the Innovation Commons tying together a network of physical locations around the world. The <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/other-people-thinking-along-the-same-lines">other people thinking along the same lines</a> page lists links to thoughts and existing locations. For Vancouver's location, here is the working mission statement:</p>  <blockquote> Build a physical, 24/7 space where Vancouver's entrepreneur community can gather to motivate each other's innovation. </blockquote>  <p>I make the distinction of the Innovation Commons as a network, because I think each place has to have it's own self-sustaining community. Part of that is having a connection with that place, right down to having a name that people can relate to. Charlottetown is small enough that &quot;Queen Street&quot; immediately evokes the locality. We need the same thing for the Vancouver location. So, coming up with an identity/name/brand will be part of the first meeting.</p>  <p>We have the good fortune to have connected with a group of four university students from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia. <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/newenterprisedevelopment">Nik, Stacy, Elicia, and Cam</a> -- thanks for being on board. They're going to be helping put together a business plan.  </p><p>I've already spoken with Dean Punzo of <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com">Take 5 Cafe</a>. He's on board in principle as the &quot;anchor tenant&quot; that will provide the cafe in the public space. His location at Granville and Hastings already plays host to dozens of &quot;in the know&quot; people. Providing much-needed sustenance and caffeine to entrepreneurs, as well as catering for after hours events such as AGMs, launch parties or other such events, this should be a profitable, self-sustaining business.</p>  <p>How to get involved/keep track? I recently set up a <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com">wiki</a> running on Drupal and hosted by my company <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a>. The <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/innovation-commons">Innovation Commons page</a> is the &quot;top&quot; of most of the information. Please tag all contributed pages as &quot;innovation commons&quot;, which you can see a filter of here -- <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/tags/innovation-commons">http://wiki.bryght.com/tags/innovation-commons</a>. There is an RSS feed for this tag <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/tags/innovation-commons/feed">here</a>.</p>  <p>What follows after the jump are some hopes and dreams for Vancouver's node of the Innovation Commons:</p> <!--break--> <ul> <li>provide 24/7 access on a membership basis -- work on your great ideas any time of day or night, without pesky cafe closing times</li> <li>provide affordable office space and shared resources for entrepreneurs and start ups</li> <li>serve as a location/funding organization where motivated co-op students (see University of Waterloo, University of Victoria) can spend semesters developing their own business ideas and/or working on open source projects, rather than more traditional work placements with actual companies</li> <li>bring the power of small teams to large companies: rent space and buy memberships for your employees (I'm looking at you, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> and <a href="http://www.blastradius.com/">Blast Radius</a>) to interact with the wider universe of small teams and innovative ideas; or even let your employees do &quot;20% work&quot; on their own projects like Google does, working at the commons one day per week</li> <li>providing a physical space for various meetups; ActiveState does a great job of doing this now, but we need access to the Internet, people! And, it should be open to everything from <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/cof/group.jsp?id=9">Vancouver Company of Friend's</a> Sunday Jams to Biodiesel enthusiasts and social venture groups</li> <li>(insert more ideas here -- create a <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/node/add/page">new page on the wiki</a>)</li> </ul>  <p>Want to participate?
