I missed Friday's second annual <a href="http://www.byte.org/blog/_archives/2004/10/1/152321.html">BlogACatMas</a>, but better late than never, right?<br />

We visited my <a title="Anne Mann's Blog at Seven Hills Bed and Breakfast, Bowen Island" href="http://www.sevenhillsbnb.com/blog/2">mom</a> on Bowen Island this weekend (<a title="Horst Mann's Profile on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/opa/">dad</a> is up at our cabin near Deka Lake). Karma the cat, having moved with us from Ottawa last December, is enjoying her new, free-roaming home with my parents.
