<blockquote>The new TiVo technology, which will become a standard feature in its video recorders, will allow users to download movies and music from the Internet to the hard drive on their video recorder. Although the current TiVo service allows users to watch broadcast, cable or satellite programs at any time, the new technology will make it possible for them to mix content from the Internet with those programs.

<p>Also mentions TiVo's purchase of Strangeberry, which is likely where these features are coming from. I talked about <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/831">Strangeberry back in January</a>.</p>
