This has been in the news a bit lately. Mitch Kapor, creator of Lotus 1-2-3, is attempting to build an open source Outlook competitor, currently named "Chandler". He founded and runs the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">OSAF - Open Source Applications Foundation</a>.

The <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/technology.htm">technology page about Chandler</a> is also interesting -- combining Python, Jabber, Zope, RDF, and Mozilla.
