Yes, it's now available, with the version listed as "0.8.0.2".

As much as I dislike the fact that Skype isn't using standard SIP, I have to congratulate them on a well put together OS X client. It's got a full Aqua look and feel, and uses all the standard OS X technologies: a drawer that slides out of the side with your contact's profile info, a customizable toolbar, and a standard preferences panel.

You can get it from the <a href="http://www.skype.com/download_osx.html" title="Download Skype for OS X">Skype for OS X</a> download page. I'll try to remember to keep it turned on for testing â€“ my username is "borismann". Leave yours in the comments if you want to test it.
