<p>I just got back from Galiano Island, one of the Southern Gulf Islands between Vancouver and Victoria/Vancouver Island. Theoretically it was a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/galiano-potlatch-2007">Drupal geek thing</a> hosted by <a href="http://instillanarchy.com/cms/" title="Instill Anarchy is an anagram of Christian&#39;s name -- cool!">Christian Nally</a>, and we did spend a fair amount of time thinking about <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/4492">install profiles for Drupal 6 core</a>.</p><p>But really, it was a chance to get out of the city, and it ended up being a great place to connect with a lot of people. Did you know, for instance, that <a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi Bryant</a> has bought a place there? I&#39;ve been doing my own thinking about how to get over Vancouver housing crisis/prices pain without doing a suburb, and Galiano is not a bad compromise.<br /></p><p>I was lucky enough to get a ride from <a href="http://www.billmacewen.com/blog/">Bill</a> of <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">WorkSpace</a>, and it turns out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/josli/">Josli</a> is actually from Galiano. I&#39;m an islander myself, having grown up on Bowen Island.<br /></p><p>Actually, the Bill / WorkSpace connection is interesting, since Nally would really like to have a &quot;WorkSpace Galiano&quot;. So, how do you grow/spread/franchise the concept/name and have it continue to succeed? Do alternate systems a la <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">OpenCoffee</a> plug into this? I have more on this rolling around, and I hope that something real/with money behind it comes of it. More soon. </p><p>P.S. Dear blogosphere: what&#39;s happening in Facebook is very important. More of the bits over there need to be dragged out here...and a lot of it is about this identity layer that&#39;s just not quite built yet out here. </p><p>P.P.S. Another great find over the weekend was <a href="http://www.unfuddle.com">Unfuddle</a>. <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com">Raincity Studios</a> have been using it for a while and have found it good (we use <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, which is a lot like it only...harder for humans). I&#39;m still kicking tires, AND I wish the codebase was open (just do the hosted service thing, guys....) but it seems very good. I still need to write up and/or do a training course on &quot;Best Practices for Drupal Development using Subversion&quot;, and Unfuddle would be a good part of it.&nbsp;</p>
