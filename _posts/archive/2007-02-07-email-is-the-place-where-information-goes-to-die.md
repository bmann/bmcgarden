	Email is the place where information goes to die</p>

<p>
	So, I&#39;ve been accused of using this phrase quite a lot.&nbsp; I figured I should probably claim it by making this blog post.</p>
<p>
	And yes, I still believe it: email and mailing list is great for quick back and forths. It&#39;s terrible for synthesizing information and finding a conclusion a week later.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m in favour of web native / crawlable archive systems. Email for notification and quick discussion, but give it a permalink to the conclusion.</p>
<p>
	I have many (many, many, ...) gripes with <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, but even if you use it as nothing more than a centralized email archive, it&#39;s pretty decent. Other strategies? The <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> wiki/ticketing/SVN repository, email enabled forums (with RSS, of course), etc.</p>
<p>
	Synthesizing and collecting all the resources we deal with is import. Help make information not die, your future self will thank you.</p>
