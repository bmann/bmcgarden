<p>I&#39;m trying to find some time to setup a development environment locally again, and I want to invest in learning an IDE. Most of the folks I know use something like emacs or TextMate to code, but I&#39;d love a little more of an environment. Also, I&#39;m still trying to find more bits and pieces that together form a set of best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining Drupal. </p><p>Initially I was thinking about learning Eclipse, except I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s PHP support isn&#39;t the greatest. Looks like the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/php/">PHP IDE isn&#39;t going to be 1.0 until June 2007</a>. But then again, <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html">IBM&#39;s Drupal tutorial also explained using Eclipse</a>. </p><p>Xcode is Apple&#39;s own tool, and there are some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/scripting/phpappledevtools.html">guides on using it for PHP</a>.</p><p>Then there&#39;s <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo">Komodo</a>, made by Vancouver&#39;s very own <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to learn an IDE that has support for multiple languages, so editors purely focused on PHP are out.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration directly with CVS / SVN is a nice to have. <a href="http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/">svnX</a> works for me as a GUI.</p>
<!--break--><p>Aside: I was using SubEthaEdit as my text editor / quick notes entry until recently (using Spotlight and / or pasting into an online wiki later). Now it&#39;s no longer free at all, and I don&#39;t use the group editing feature enough to make it worthwhile. Enter <a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a> -- it even has a nice one-window view, which is much better than the 10 text documents I used to have floating around.&nbsp;</p>
