<p>Yes, I finally got a new cellphone. My Nokia 6630 lasted me 2 years, and has been a great phone. But, I&#39;m finding the need for a smartphone -- calendar, to do&#39;s, and email at my fingertips. Hence, sticking with my favourite platform, the Nokia E61 was the best choice for me. If I wanted to do more multimedia with my phone, I would have held out for the Nokia N95, with 5Mp camera and integrated GPS, including geotagging of photos on the fly. *drool* If I had wanted a phone with camera in the same price range as the E61, my pick would have been the Nokia N80 (which is what <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> just picked up to replace his Sidekick).<br /></p><p>Regardless...I will miss having a cameraphone. I&#39;ll have to see what kind of camera or picture taking workflow will make it easy to still upload photos on the fly. </p><p>Even better, I didn&#39;t even have to travel to Europe to actually buy the phone. I got it at <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?q=cell+baby&amp;near=Vancouver,+BC,+Canada&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=49250494,-123111934,1994400973961306932&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=2">Cellular Baby</a>, just a few blocks from my house.</p><p>My first impression of the phone: fast! The UI is very responsive, and it comes loaded with applications. I haven&#39;t had much of a chance to add extra applications. I&#39;ll be putting Opera on, even though the built in browser is surprisingly usable in some ways.<br /></p><p>But of course, does it work with Macs? Well, it&#39;s not officially supported by iSync. I used <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060511162644120">this post</a> to add an entry to the plist file to trick iSync into working with it.</p><p>I really like the keyboard. It&#39;s a compact QWERTY keyboard, and I&#39;ve already sent several test emails from it. Oh, and of course, it does have wifi. There is a hotspot finder that makes it easy to scan for connections and then create an access point / connect, without having to predefine them.</p><p>More soon, as I add some more apps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
