<p>Lloyd responded to my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1534">Flock feedback</a> and
I'm finally finding a few minutes in the middle of the night to respond.<br /></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Q: How do I give feedback? A: http://beta.flock.com/feedback, and Help
Menu &gt; Give Feedback</span><br style="font-weight: bold;" /></p>
<p>That feedback doesn't seem very friendly and seems
very bug focused -- don't you want suggestions as well. A forum? <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>
just used their threaded discussion groups to gather feedback, report
bugs, etc. On the other extreme, <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com">The Robots</a> use <a href="http://www.43things.com">43
Things</a> alien technology to allow users to actually rate/rank desired
features and bugs.<br /></p>
<p>The Help Menu item is nicely hidden. I explore menus once, but I
don't tend to go there much. While you're in this early alpha/beta
stage, you might want to include an actual toolbar button for
feedback/bugs -- Safari used to have this on by default in the early
days, and it's still a toolbar option. Another option might be to add feedback to the magic plus button dropdown menu (does this have a name?).<br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How do I manually configure my blog settings? A: ???</span><br /></p>
<p>I actually found the "Options" menu, so the new bug report should actually read as follows:<br /></p>
<p>Title: Blog manager does not let you customize your blog settings if it fails to auto-detect<br /></p>
<p>It seems to only reliably detect WordPress blogs.<br /></p>
<p>Work around: have the blog manager auto-detect something that auto-detects successfully. Then, use Options &gt; Configure blog to change the settings to whatever you like. I am very likely the first person to suck down content from a Basic Auth protected Drupal site using Blog Manager :P<br /></p>
<p>Now that I'm working with the Blog Manager (it's how I made this post), I have some feedback there, too.<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>I don't see a button for adding links. I can drag and drop links from my shelf, but I can't hilight text and add a link (ahh...found it using ctl-click in context menu...I think you still need a toolbar button).</li>
<li>Hitting return creates a &lt;br&gt;. Hitting return multiple times some times magically transforms this into a &lt;p&gt; tag. I'd like an option whether return creates paragraphs or line-breaks by default -- I like return to be a paragraph, and shift-return to get a line break.</li>
<li>I get nervous when there is no obvious "save" button when I'm in draft mode (/me copies the source from this long post)</li></ol>And here's a nice picture of a tree in Victoria as thanks for letting me play with this tool.<br /><br /><a title="undefined" href="http://flickr.com/photos/35034346160@N01/34228762"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 180px; height: 240px; text-align: center;" alt="Flickr Photo" src="http://photos22.flickr.com/34228762_90ceea5807_m.jpg" /></a>
