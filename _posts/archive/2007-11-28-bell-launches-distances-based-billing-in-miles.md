<p>So, my friend Dave in Ottawa posted about how he received a flyer, showing <a href="http://smithdm3.com/what-bell-thinking-new-deregulated-long-distance">Bell's new deregulated long distance rates</a>, to go into effect at the end of January 2008. As I said in the comments on his post, you can practically "hear" his disbelief at this move: the base long distance rates rates are based on....distance. Using Canada's national unit of measure, the "mile" of course. Err...what?</p>

<p>Here's the scan that Dave did of the new rates:</p>

<p>I'm still checking to see if it's April Fools early this year or not...<a href="http://smithdm3.com/what-bell-thinking-new-deregulated-long-distance">read the full level of ridiculousness over at Dave's site</a>.</p>
