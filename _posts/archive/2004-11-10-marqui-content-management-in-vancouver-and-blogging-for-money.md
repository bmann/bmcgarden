<p><a href="http://marc.blogs.it">Marc</a> Canter has gotten quite the <a href="http://www.marqui.com/Newsroom/event11100498593507.aspx">storm of controversy</a> about paying bloggers to...blog. Of course, Marc won't get any respect until, say, <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2004/11/ojr-msn-gm-imagines-blogging-business.html">Microsoft does it</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> and I met with Marc Tuesday night to go over some Bryght business (<a href="http://realneo.contenthosting.org" title="REALNEO">this</a>, <a href="http://www.ourmedia.org" title="OurMedia - The Global Home for Grassroots Media">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.peopleaggregator.com">this</a>, if you must know). Marc also gave us a preview of the new <a href="http://www.marqui.com">Marqui</a> (nee <a href="http://www.maestrocms.com">MaestroCMS</a>) demo. Marqui has some great workflow features, they output to multiple formats, and they even have RSS feeds in their <a href="http://www.marqui.com/Newsroom/">newsroom</a> now.</p>

<p>Would reviewing a <a href="/topics/cms" title="Content Management Systems Category">CMS</a> make sense for my blog? Absolutely.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Yes, my <a href="http://www.bryght.com" title="Bryght - Drupal-powered Managed Community Content and Web Publishing">business</a> might be considered a competitor, but I've already been thinking how the two systems could work together. Let Marqui handle the complicated workflow of larger corporations and a mass of static content. Let Bryght handle your community site, developer forums, or other highly-dynamic sections of your web presence.</p>

<p>Heck -- this post might be my first entry in a paycheque from Marqui. (Disclaimer: I'm <strong>not</strong> being paid to post this right now)</p>

<p>In any case, congratulations to Marc and Marqui. It's great to see another Vancouver company doing really interesting work, and succeeding.</p>
