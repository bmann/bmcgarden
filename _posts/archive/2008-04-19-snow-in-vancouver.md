<p>Just as spring is hitting the east coast, Mother Nature decides to play a trick on us here in Vancouver. I heard that this has been the coldest spring since sometime in the 1950s. This morning the snow is on hedges and building roofs, but has essentially all melted from the ground. But still...</p>

<p>To put this in perspective for how wacky the weather has been, last weekend was spent wearing short sleeved shirts, getting a sunburn on my nose, and finding a place to stop for popsicles.

<p>And now some quotes to think about:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/james_russell_lowell.html">James Russell Lowell</a> - "Fate loves the fearless."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freewillastrology.com/horoscopes/pisces.html" title="Lack of permalinks suck...">Free Will Astrology (Pisces, April 17th, 2008)</a> - "If you don't articulate your conscious desires, your unconscious patterns will come true."</p>

<p>I hope your spring is going well, wherever in the world you are.</p>
