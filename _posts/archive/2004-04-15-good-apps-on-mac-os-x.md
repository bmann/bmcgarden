<p>Brad Choate made an <a href="http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2004/04/14/inventory">inventory of all his OS X apps</a> -- very extensive, and a good guide to look at. I've already downloaded a couple. Probably worthwhile to go back and (re)comment on each one.</p>

<p>Justin Blanton posted in the comments that he also had a <a href="http://justinblanton.com/archives/2004/03/29/required_os_x_programs/">list of required OS X programs</a>.</p>

<p>Great…now it's late already and I have a bunch of new programs to try out…</p>
