<p>For the first time, I'm fully participating in <a href="http://ca.movember.com/">Movember</a>.</p>
<p>What is Movember? Movember is an annual event to raise awareness about and research funds for prostate cancer. The "Mo" refers to the fact that participants commit to starting the month clean shaven, and growing a moustache for the entire month of November. Along the way, funds are raised through a variety of activities to donate to Prostate Cancer Canada.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've been completely clean shaven for perhaps 4 or 5 years. One of the things that motivated me was that I now <a href="http://www.iqmetrix.com/article/2010/10/movember-2010-support-iqmetrix-moustache-alliance">work for a company/with co-workers that actively participates in and helps supports charitable giving and fundraising</a>. It's great to be surround by this type of energy, and I'm proud to be part of the <a href="http://ca.movember.com/mospace/22421/">iQmetrix Moustache Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>The second, and much more important reason, that I'm fully participating is to support my <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com">dad</a>. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. It was a hard and scary time for everyone, him most especially. It was diagnosed early, the cancer was treated, and he made a full recovery. In fact, he went on to <a href="http://horst.wordpress.com/2009/11/15/my-el-camino-a-view-from-today/">walk the Camino for the second time</a> (an 800km long walk that crosses most of Spain). I'm very glad to still have my dad in my life, and I hope everyone gets tested often and that better cures can be found.</p>
