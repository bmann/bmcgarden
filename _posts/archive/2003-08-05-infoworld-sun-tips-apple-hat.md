Phil sent me <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/000016.html">this InfoWorld article</a>:
<blockquote>Is Sun working on a desktop partnership with Apple? The question surfaced during the media Q&A session and Schwartz looked to his execs for backup. "We don't comment on partnerships," responded Sun CTO of Software John Fowler.

Implicitly acknowledging the demo had that certain OS X-like sheen, Schwartz went on. "I don't think there is a Sun employee that doesn't love Apple. We would love to partner with Apple, they are everyone's favorite company. Stay tuned."</blockquote>Verrrrryy interesting, grasshopper.

The press conference was actually demoing "Project Mad Hatter" -- a Sun bundle of Linux-based desktop apps (a little more info <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/it_management/2003073001426NWDTSW">here</a> and <a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/dailyarchives.asp?ArticleID=43727">here</a> -- post in comments if you find more).

I'm still looking for a server OSS stack. Wanted: shared calendaring and contacts on an OSS server that lets people use Windows/Outlook on the client side. There are a bunch that are close, but they mainly don't seem to scale down very well (OpenGroupware and Bynari are the leading contenders, FWIW).
