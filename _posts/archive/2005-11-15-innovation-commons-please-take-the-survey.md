<p>The <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/newenterprisedevelopment" target="_self">New Enterprise Development team</a> have done a great job in designing a survey to gather some more information for the Vancouver Innovation Commons location. Please head over to the wiki and <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/innovation-commons-survey" target="_self">take the survey</a>.</p><p>The team has also put together some preliminary numbers on what is needed to make this a reality, but there are definitely some more rounds of feedback needed. I can report that I had a great meeting the other day with Charles Holmes of SFU's Learning Strategies group, who is involved in too many cool local projects to grasp -- everything from a project with the Dalai Lama to an upcoming &quot;30 Days of Sustainability&quot; in March. I bring it up because especially the latter project, which focuses on sustainability, could certainly see some tie-ins to potential evolutions of the Innovation Commons. At the very least, I hope that Vancouver's tech/entreprenuer community can be a part of the event here in Vancouver.<br /> </p><p>Probably another get together in a couple of weeks to share findings and brainstorm some next steps.<br /> </p><p>P.S. <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com" target="_self">Colin</a> checked out the Waves coffee shop that recently opened with free wireless, and open 24 hours. Definitely no competition in the coffee department (&quot;worse than Starbucks&quot; was the phrase used), and it didn't have a great vibe. I'll have to check it out for myself, maybe even late one night.&nbsp;</p>
