<p><a href="http://drupal.org/user/409">Jeremy</a> just released the new version of his <a href="http://www.kerneltrap.org/jeremy/drupal/spam/">Drupal spam module</a>. Yes, it's true that Drupal sites suffer from spam as well -- it's just always had a comment moderation system, so you can easily place comments from anonymous users into an approval queue.</p>

<p>This works great at low volumes. For high traffic sites that get lots of high traffic spam...it doesn't work at all. Legitimate comments get drowned out by a flood of spam -- e.g. I have 36,000+ comments sitting in my approval queue. But, since I've been an advocate of <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1329">open comments</a>, I didn't want to close things down and force people to <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/user/register">register</a>.</p>

<p>So, tougher measures are called for, and at 10:30PM PST tonight, the first piece of p*ker comment spam bit the dust. And I didn't even need captchas. Thanks, Jeremy!</p>
