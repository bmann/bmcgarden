<p>I've been using ShoZu for several weeks now. It's an application for your cameraphone that will automatically upload pictures that you take to Flickr. As in, you take the picture, and seconds later, ShoZu will connect to the network (GPRS in my case) in the background, and upload to Flickr. I've got it set to fully automatic, but you can also set it to ask you each time you take a picture whether it should be uploaded to Flickr or not.</p><p>It's made me actually take more pictures with my phone, as well as actually getting them off my phone to share. You can see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/tags/ShoZu/" target="_self">pictures I've uploaded with ShoZu</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ShoZu/" target="_self">all pictures on Flickr tagged with ShoZu</a> (over 4000 as I'm making this post).&nbsp;</p>
