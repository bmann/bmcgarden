<p><a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org"><img src="/system/files?file=banner.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>&nbsp;</p><p>OSCMS Summit is something that I helped pull together in short order <a href="http://2006.oscms-summit.org">last year</a>. We had great attendance (about 300 people over 3 days, with about 150 people per day) and lots of local Vancouverites mixing in.</p><p>This year, Vancouver has the <a href="http://vancouver.php.net/php_conference">Vancouver PHP Conference</a> which is going on right now, and the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org">OSCMS Summit 2007</a> is happening down at Yahoo&#39;s Sunnyvale campus. Yep, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>: we joked about this a while back, and then some of the folks we know inside Yahoo said -- sure, we&#39;d love to help out with this. Moral of the story: ask and ye shall receive. I have to say, Yahoo should be applauded for this: they&#39;ve really been reaching out to developers lately, with great events like Hack Day showing off some of the great work they&#39;ve got going on. </p><p>Once again, the OSCMS Summit will be a kind of &quot;container&quot; event for other projects to gather around. This does mean the Drupal hordes will be descending...but, if all I wanted to do was a Drupalcon, that&#39;s what I would push for. I&#39;m still really passionate about having various open source projects come together and discuss solutions and approaches to web content: we&#39;re all facing the same challenges and the nature of open source means it&#39;s that much easier for us to learn from one another.&nbsp;</p><p>There are already a selection of projects attending the summit, with a wide range of topics. We&#39;re soliciting sessions until the end of this week. Add your project, add your sessions suggestion.<br /></p><p>And of course, please do go ahead and register if you plan to ahead: we&#39;re rapidly approaching our original cap of 250 attendees, so may have to go back and ask for more space, as it definitely seems there is enough interest.</p><p>March 22nd and 23rd, Yahoo campus in Sunnyvale: see you there!&nbsp;</p>
