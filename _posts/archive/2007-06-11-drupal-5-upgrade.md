<p>OK, BMC is sitting on Drupal 5 now. From 4.6 to 5.0 in one fairly painless move. I expect lots of stuff will be broken. I've got <a href="http://drupal.org/project/simplemenu">SimpleMenu</a>, which makes me happy.</p>

<p>I'm going to be re-arranging things a lot and try and draw a bunch of my presence back into this spot. Including a partial re-integration of <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">personal</a>.</p>
