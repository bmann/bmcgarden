<p>This is <strong>very</strong> interesting. Mitel has spun off a company called <a href="http://mkcnetworks.com/" title="MKC Networks, formerly Mitel Knowledge Corp">MKC Networks</a> (formerly Mitel Knowledge Corp) to focus on VoIP solutions built around the e-smith server. I heard about this through a <a href="http://contribs.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=11">posting on the Contribs.org site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I have asked for permission from the company to offer all of you a 5 User license for your own copy of the <a href="http://mkcnetworks.com/products/7000cs.asp">7000CS communication server</a>. For those of you who don't know what it is, it's a SIP based PBX/Router that runs on top of the SMEServer. It has integral voicemail, auto-attendant, Back-to-back User agent, call router, SIP registration server and much more.

<p>This is a great. An easily installable, almost off-the-shelf solution for branch office networking and VoIP. Heck, the pricing is almost cheap enough that you could actually bring all the components along for a demo.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> now this makes sense -- <a href="http://www.pingtel.com/a_pressrelease.jsp?pressreleaseid=125">Pingtel announced it's open sourcing</a> all it's SIP-based IP-PBX stuff. Mitel has some advantages because of their familiarity with the e-smith platfrom, but they never leveraged open source as well as they could have.</p>
