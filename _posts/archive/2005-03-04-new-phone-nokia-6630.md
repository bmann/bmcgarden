<p>My &quot;old&quot; P800 gave up the ghost: the keypad stopped working. I got pretty frustrated with it in any case -- the UI felt kludgy and the stylus wasn't that great for working with it. The scroll wheel was nice, but not enough to make up for all the other deficiencies. I briefly used a temporary, do-nothing phone with no computer synchronization, no Bluetooth, nothin'. The experience was not pleasant, just lots of flipping open the laptop just to get someone's number.</p>

<p>After seeing what <a href="http://www.bryanrieger.com">Bryan Rieger</a> is doing with Flash on phones, and the fact that only Nokia has licensed it so far, I decided to get a Nokia phone.</p>

<p>I got my new Nokia 6630 just yesterday, and am still figuring it out. This <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000363.html">Loud Thinking blog post</a> has lots of good info on why it's the Best. Phone. Ever... as well as linking to a lot of useful applications.</p>

<p>I'm also going to link to this page of <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/7418">Fido GPRS settings</a>, since I had to re-enter them.</p>

<p>(Yes, I do have to wait until <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger">Tiger</a> before it will sync with my laptop, but it's *really* easy to add contacts as people call)</p>
