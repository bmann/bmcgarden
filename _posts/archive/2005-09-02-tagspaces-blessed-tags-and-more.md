<p>Tags are being overloaded today as info-routers -- a loosely-coupled, loosely-typed way of shunting around data. People are excited by this, because it just works. For the record, I'm not against tags, I just have some concerns about how current implementations are susceptible to spam, and really am more interested in the next step beyond -- personal and shared tagspaces.</p>

<p>This is not quite topics in the sky or anything like that, but more of a pointer or agreement that a group has decided to mean the same thing when they're using tags. As well, an agreement that they've decided to populate/aggregate a particular tagspace (instead of everyone using <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags">someone else's tagspace</a>). For example, <A href="http://www.whatsweb20.com">What's Web 2.0?</a> might create a <a href="http://www.whatsweb20.com/glossary">glossary</a> defining terms (== tags) used there, and I could point all the tags that I use locally at their <a href="http://www.whatsweb20.com/tags/">tagspace</a> (this last link will be up in a bit...).</p>

<p>I talked a little bit about the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1543" title="Link farming the future">del.icio.us use of the "for:username" tag</a> while explaining my use of links. That got me thinking, along with observing how <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> might eventually deal with groups, about blessing or formalizing the use of "for:" and perhaps "forgroup:" as standard usages.</p>

<p>There is background for this, in the use of tagging that acts as a review or rating (what's the link for this? rating:6 plus Amazon ASIN), as well as intense use of place name and/or latitude/longitude usage to tie together information such as photos or blog posts to map data, a.k.a. geotagging.</p>

<p>Permissions is the tricky part of this. People can spam me directly by adding "for:borismann" to their del.icio.us links. A group would have the same issue. But, if we can set those issues aside for the moment -- basically leaving it up to the implementing system on how to deal with this (e.g. friend and group lists that only allow certain accounts to do this) -- this might be an interesting way to form another level of organization around "just" simple tagging.</p>

<p>Finally, a ramble on "blessed" tags. It's a bit like a bottom up taxonomy creation and/or knowledge gardening -- watch tags form, then bless certain ones with special displays that give people an incentive to stick to the blessed formats of tags. For example, on <a href="http://www.43places.com">43 Places</a> I stick to a personal format of making sure all eating places are tagged as "restaurant". Helper displays for metro areas would be quite easy to show -- e.g. top 10 most visited restaurants for Vancouver (teaser: and might actually be extracted remotely with a forthcoming API). Still, the spam issue. How to give people anti-tagging powers? Hey, I know -- we'll bless the "not:restaurant" format! A whole new level of tag fighting...</p>
