Victoria

Here is a photo of the damage from the terrible
coastal storm that passed through Victoria last  week.
Most people stayed home and most schools were
cancelled. It really makes you cherish what you
have, and reminds us not to take life for granted. 
Warning: Following picture is quite graphic and may
not be suitable for younger viewers.

<p>Yes, it's true that there are some terrible storms. I had to cinch the hood of my rain jacket a little tighter the other day :p</p>
