	Found this over at the Planet GNOME pages, which seems to have similar bearing on the problem with lists:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Rather than fragmenting lists by &quot;general topic&quot;, which seems not to work, why don&#39;t we fragment list traffic on a per discussion basis. Very few discussions will need this, but the few that do we can not destroy the public list&#39;s readability for the week+ it takes to run its course.</p>

	A solution for implementing Seth&#39;s idea (which were based around the same signal-to-noise issues that I thought of) would be to use <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/">QuickTopic</a>.</p>
