<p>Go to <a href="http://www2.sprintcanada.ca/Enterprise/">Sprint Canada's Enterprise site</a> using Safari on OS X. You should be greeted by a lovely message that says:</p>

<blockquote>
Sorry, we are currently not supporting Netscape 6 at this time. Please use Netscape 4.x or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x/5.x .
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily (?), Firefox gets through just fine. The question mark is why I would want to keep dealing with Sprint…</p>

<p>There is no excuse today for designing a public website (not a web application, just your basic corporate website) that doesn't automatically work with <strong>all</strong> browsers.</p>

<p>The rest of the site is equally bad. I'm not going to decompose it completely, but just mention that typing "order T1" into the search box generates…zero results. I'm self-selecting as a customer that <em>wants to order a service from Sprint</em> -- and they have no results for me.</p>
