<p>After about 3 years of running multisite and working on some variant of &quot;install profiles&quot; with our whole team at <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a>, I reactivated my CVS account on Drupal.org and created the Install Profile API &quot;module&quot;.</p><p>I&#39;m incredibly proud of <a href="http://drupal.org/cvs?commit=62627">commit 62627</a>.   </p><p>As <a href="http://www.civicspacelabs.org">Kieran Lal of CivicSpace</a> said at the recent <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org">OSCMS Summit</a>, creating install profiles creates a new &quot;profession&quot; in the Drupal ecosystem: install profile maintainer.</p><p>It combines the consulting skills of taking business requirements and translating those into a selection of Drupal modules and configuration. It takes a bit of rigor and diligence to keep track of included modules, and listening to the community that is using your install profile.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;m excited about the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Installation+profiles">installation profiles on drupal.org</a>. Every community can potentially bundle a custom package and easily leapfrog the (frustrating) learning stage of what module should I use and how do I configure this.</p><p>Every large organization that needs to deploy departmental websites.</p><p>Every consulting shop can have their own custom bundle when approaching projects.</p><p>Yep, I&#39;m excited. Forward!&nbsp;</p>
