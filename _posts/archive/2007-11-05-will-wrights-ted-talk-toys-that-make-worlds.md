<p>I got some feedback in Facebook thanking me for posting about <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/146">the video of Will Wright's talk at TED</a>. So, I thought I would post about it here to spread it a little farther rather than <a href="http://boris.jaiku.com/presence/16394515">hiding it in Jaiku</a>.</p>

<p>Wright talks about his upcoming / much awaited game <a href="http://www.spore.com/">Spore</a> in the context of thinking about how "games" or rather tools that appear as games, can help us understand/explore the world around us. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)">Will Wright</a>, for those who aren't gamers, is the creator of all of the "Sim" series of games, starting way back in 1989 with SimCity.</p>

<p>To say that I'm looking forward to this "game" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
