<p>I went over to Elastic Path in the pouring Vancouver winter rain yesterday and did a <a href="http://company.getelastic.com/blogging-for-retailers-get-elastic-18/">podcast</a> with Dave Olsen and Jason Billingsley. We talked about blogging for retailers (<a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/resources/white-paper/blogging-for-retailers/index.jsp">white paper</a>), which Elastic Path has put together a ton of information for online retailers on what they need to know about blogging.</p><p>Luckily, I had just been reading <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/01/why_id_make_eve.html">A VC&#39;s post on Why I&#39;d Make Every E-Merchant Become a Blogger</a>, which covers lots of the same ground.</p><p>I really enjoyed doing the podcast with Dave. Looking back, I&#39;ve thought about and written on these topics for many years now, and it feels comfortable and natural to be sitting around talking about them. More podcasts. How? Not sure :P</p><p>Elastic Path is an interesting company here in our Vancouver back yard. They&#39;re doing very interesting stuff, with more on the way. How are they doing? Well, their demo site ranks so highly for <a href="http://demo.elasticpath.com/film-cameras/waterproof-camera/c90000012-p1.html">waterproof cameras</a> that they had to plaster it with notices to make it clear it was a demo. Combine that with a blogging strategy and you could sell a lot of whatever widgets you&#39;re selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and the <a href="http://monkeyblaster9000.bryght.net">MonkeyBlaster 9000</a>? It&#39;s a fantastically fun summer toy that every child will want this summer...&nbsp;</p>
