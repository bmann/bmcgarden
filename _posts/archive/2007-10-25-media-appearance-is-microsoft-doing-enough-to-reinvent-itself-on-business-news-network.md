<p>I'm going to be on <a href="http://www.bnn.ca" title="BNN">Business News Network</a> this afternoon, 4pm PST / 7pm EST, talking about if Microsoft is still innovating? This is, of course, related in part to earnings announcements from a bunch of companies, and more directly, the Microsoft investment in Facebook. I'll be on a mini-panel with <a href="http://techblog.typepad.com/">Fred Vogelstein</a>.</p>

<p>Some related links / thoughts below, I'll clean this up after the interview:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Battelle on <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004054.php">Facebook and Microsoft</a></li>
<li>Paul Kedrosky on <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/10/25/facebook_and_th.html">Facebook and the Microsoft Curse</a>:<blockquote>Do you believe that Microsoft knows its own strategic interests, and that it can act rationally and appropriately in their defense? Ten years ago I might have said yes, but today I have a much harder time. So when it comes to defending a large strategic premium over a credible competitor with a better basis for economic valuation, I have a hard time. </blockquote></li> 
<li>Recent interview with <a href="http://blip.tv/file/438400">Steve Ballmer at the Web 2.0 Summit</a> -- from Ballmer on Windows Live search, "it's like a 6 year old playing hoops with the 12 year olds"</li>
<li>Did Microsoft pay too much for Facebook? Well, Facebook might be overvalued, but it's small dollars for Microsoft and gives them potential insite into profile / social based advertising</li>
<li>MSFT failures -- Zune, Windows Mobile (failure outside of the US), search</li>
<li>MSFT wins and/or in progress -- Silverlight, an Adobe Flash competitor, casual gaming and home based social networks (XBox Live Arcade, Windows Media Center, etc.)</li>
<li>innovation? Microsoft Research (PhotoSynth), new offices and working environments down in Redmond and elsewhere</li>
<li>closing thought: competition is good, Microsoft isn't going anywhere; they *should* compete more on innovation rather than dollars and marketing</li>
</ul>
