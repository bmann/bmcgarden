<p><a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> and I are heading down to Seattle to hang with the <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com">'gnomes</a> today (Monday, July 25th).</p>

<p>I think we'll probably stay the whole day and likely have time for a Web 2.0 dinner. Any takers? Like...<a href="http://www.commoncraft.com">Lee</a>, <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com">Robots</a>, <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a>, <a href="http://www.scottstuff.net">Scott</a>? I'm sure I've forgotten people, but it's &quot;today&quot; already and I need to go to sleep/get up early (and Kris will likely fill in some more for me...).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> we're heading to <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&client=safari&rls=en&q=chinoise&near=Seattle,+WA&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=47606389,-122330833,6605340101891054864">Chinoise on Madison</a> at 6:30pm. <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com">Chris</a> says it's &quot;pan asian&quot;, which apparently means it has sushi plus more (i.e. non-sushi stuff).</p>

<p>And yes, as you can see by my comments, I did forget a bunch of people. I need to start filtering by city or something, although that wouldn't have helped with <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/197080">Bainbridge Island</a>. Here are some more pings: <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/">Matt May</a>, <a href="http://www.nickfinck.com/">Nick</a>?</p>
