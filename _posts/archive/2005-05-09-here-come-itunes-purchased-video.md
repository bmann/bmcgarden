<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1062">AppleInsider</a> broke the news that iTunes 4.8 (not yet in Software Update, you can get it from <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes" title="Apple iTunes download">Apple directly</a>) supports Quicktime content. Specifically, you can play videos directly in iTunes, either in the main window, a separate window (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000323042773">Engadget as a good screenshot</a>), or...full screen.</p>

<p>As you can see from the screenshot, movie content is stored directly within iTunes, much like a regular audio file. The fields don't make as much sense, but that's easy enough to fix in later versions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://forums.appleinsider.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=53955">AppleInsider forum thread</a> is filled with various bits of dis-information, but there were some good tidbits.</p>

<p>One of the lines of discussion was about the different apps and how they fit together. iPhoto 5 supports storing/organizing videos from your camera, and iMovie is for editing movies; why in iTunes as well? Well, one view is that iTunes is for paid content (movie/TV downloads!) and organizing (think video playlists/search/etc.) not importing/editing of your created content.</p>

<p>Oh right, and of course, <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1424">iTunes is the only app that plays with Windows</a>, so that's where movie download/sales stuff has to live.</p>

<p>There might even be a smoking gun. The excellent ArsTechnica forum had <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/8300945231/m/159002623731/r/442000723731#442000723731">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just looked through the strings in the iTunes executable file.</p>

<p>The first one I found was "Has Video," mixed in with attributes like "Has Variable Bit Rate" and "Genre."</p>

<p>The second is a bit more interesting. After "Purchased Music": "Purchased Videos"!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/05/airvideo_and_im.html">Christopher Allen points to "AirVideo"</a> -- video delivered via an upgrade to the AirPort Express. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/05/10.html#a10042">Scoble isn't sure it's an Apple employee</a> where the comments originated on Slashdot. I've always thought that there's more than meets the eye in the AirPort Express (<a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1263">like VoIP</a>).</p>
