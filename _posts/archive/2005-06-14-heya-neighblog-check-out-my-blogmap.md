<div style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0;"><script lang="javascript" src="http://www.feedmap.net/blogmap/blogapi.ashx?method=blogmapbadge&feed=http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/feed"></script></div>

<p>I also have <a href="http://www.feedmap.net/blogmap/neighblogs.aspx?feed=http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/feed">NeighBlogs</a>, like <a href="http://www.jamehealy.com/">Jame Healy</a> who reminded me about this -- he came by the office a long, long time ago (*wink*) and is getting his site up to speed. He's a Microsoft guy (won't hold that against him, some of the <a href="http://www.scobleizer.com">best people</a> are 'softies) and works over at <a href="http://www.sunaptic.com/">Sunaptic</a>.</p>

<p>These MapPoint services are pretty easy to use and integrate but they look...well, they look crufty and not very smooth. Is this just for the free versions? They remind me of MapQuest, which is also definitely showing it's age compared to Yahoo or Google.</p>

<p>(And yes, I do feel dirty having used the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1473" title="I really don't like the term blog">b word</a> that many times in one post)</p>
