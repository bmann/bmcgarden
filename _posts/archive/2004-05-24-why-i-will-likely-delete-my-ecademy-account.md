<p>After signing up for <a href="http://www.ecademy.com">Ecademy</a> almost 2 years ago, I am likely going to ask to have my account deleted.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I recently met some <a href="http://www.moosehat.com" title="Stewart and Jessica Marshall's Moosehat Blog">great Ecademy people</a> and so decided to give the whole thing another serious look.</p>

<p>Going back in, I found that I had been given a "<a href="http://ecademy.com/node.php?title=Power+Networker">Power Networker</a>" trial period. You can see that last link for the full list of features that are enabled by this (access to <a href="http://www.regus.com">Regus</a> meeting centers alone looks good, although there aren't many in Canada). The usual price is $15US per month or $150US annually.</p>

<p>All well and good, and as <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> says, "Ecademy is the friendliest social network". I sent messages back and forth, found some more clubs (which are pretty much topic-specific forums or communities of interest) and all was good.</p>

<p>I did struggle with the Ecademy interface. It never was clear to me how you "connect" with someone. This takes place, apparently, by exchanging messages -- you can't connect without sending a message, and by sending a message you automatically connect.</p>

<p>Except, once the trial period expired, I could no longer connect with people. OK, fine, I really was just testing it in any case. But here's the tricky part: if someone sends me a message, <strong>I can't respond</strong>. Yes, that's right -- since I'm over my limit with connections (10 if you are not a "Power Networker"), and since "connecting" is done by replying to a message (or sending? this still isn't clear), and since I'm not allowed to connect to any more people, I can no longer respond to messages people send me.</p>

<p>So, here's what I need from Ecademy in order for me to not delete my account: Give me the option to send an "auto-reply" message if I'm not able to respond; I can then choose to include my email address, a link to my website, or some alternate means of contacting me if people are interested.</p>

<p>I should also put in a generic rant about how I will not allow anyone, much less an online social network, to limit the communications that I have with fellow human beings. I understand the need for Ecademy to build a business model (except <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/1136">I think that social networking doesn't have a business model</a>), but the current situation really is no good.</p>
