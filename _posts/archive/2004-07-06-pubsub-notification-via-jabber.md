The <a href="http://www.jabber.org/pipermail/standards-jig/2004-June/005545.html">news</a> about the <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> service is really exciting both for us and the rest of the Jabber community. We've been saying all along that IM and syndication belong together, and the PubSub service is the server side extension to that vision.  The most exciting part for me about a PubSub like service, is the possibility to subscribe to a topic, and then get notified within in seconds of the actual post. It's basically like subscribing to Google results and being instantly notified when Google discovers a new webpage matching your query. Very exciting.
