I grabbed some coffee, some beer, and some North Beach pizza from the common areas, and then landed straight in an intense session about microformats.</p>  <p><a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> and <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">Chris Messina</a> are trying to herd us cats in the room as we think about what &quot;actions&quot; we can do if there is lots of data that is microformat-enabled online.</p>  <p>I&#39;m hearing lots of actions that at their base sound like publish and subscribe actions. But we&#39;re trying to stick at the UI layer -- one of Messina&#39;s stated goals was actions that are the same across sites for the same type of data. e.g. a Greasemonkey plugin that could do &quot;add as contact&quot; when given an hCard, no matter which site you are on.</p>
