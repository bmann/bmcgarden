<p>Lots of hype about the recent funding of Skype to the tune of $18M US. Yes, part of this is the classic "let's run with this and look for a business model later". <strong>But</strong> let's not forget that Skype is a true disruptor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If recent announcements are correct then we will see the capability for Skype to Phone (as in PSTN). There is a general assumption that Skype will have to charge for calls into the local phone network or to a local cellphone. I believe their intent will be to make such calls free.</p>

<p>Comparisons are being made to Hotmail, which was one of the first free email providers. Now for the punch line: email <em>is</em> now essentially free (nevermind the part about how many would also now gladly pay for virus- and spam-free email -- that's the other side of the curve).</p>

<p>I think that Skype could very easily and cheaply build out VoIP gateways with nothing more than a couple of local phone lines and some Linux gear.</p>
