	<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com">Roland</a> handed off his <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca/vancity_bike_share>VanCity Bike Share</a> bike to me today. I did a test drive a while back, and now have the bike for 3 weeks, until I hand it off to someone else. I can even <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca/tags/bikesharerequest>search ChangeEverything.ca for people wanting a bike handoff</a>. A neat program, I'll try and do some more posts on where my red bike takes me.<br />
<br />
Takes about 20 minutes to bike home from the office. I'll do another post with my route on a Google map.
