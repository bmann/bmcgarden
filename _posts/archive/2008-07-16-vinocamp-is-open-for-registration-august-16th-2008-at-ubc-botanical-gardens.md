<p>Yes, I'm getting involved in yet-another-event. I was overjoyed when I heard that <a href="http://noboundaries.typepad.com/">Lori Pike</a> had made the jump out of tech and into a great marketing position with <a href="http://www.missionhillwinery.com/">Mission Hill</a>. I mumbled something about a <a href="http://winecamp.pbwiki.com/">WineCamp</a>, a similar-but-different* event that started down in San Francisco / Napa Valley.</p>

<p>Lori took the idea, went off and got approval, and then came back and called me on actually helping organize this thing. A bunch more volunteer organizers were called out, meetings were had, and now, we bring you ... <a href="http://vinocamp.com" title="VinoCamp is a Vancouver wine unconference">VinoCamp</a>! Here's the blurb:</p>

<a href="http://vinocamp.com" title="VinoCamp is a Vancouver wine unconference"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2673789326_2003221d16_o.jpg" width="211" height="77" alt="VinoCamp Summer 2008 Logo" align="left" style="padding: 5 15 10 0;"/></a>

<blockquote>
<p>This is definitely not the wine festival. In a more unstructured form than a standard conference, VinoCampVancouver brings wine, people and technology together in one place, making wine accessible, educational and fun.  As a different type of conference, VinoCamp is designed for those interested in technology and wine, and people are expected to take photos of what's happening, and to blog or tweet or message about their experiences.</p>

<p>Join us! Whether you're speaker, sponsor, or a wine-drinker, our aim is to make this day memorable, fun, and interesting. You will learn more about wine and viticulture, meet interesting people, and enjoy yourself in one of Vancouver's loveliest gardens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a full day (approx. 10-4) and is being held on August 16th at UBC Botanical Garden.  We're expecting about 125 people. Registration is open now, and tickets are $50 for the full day event (t-shirt, lunch, wine, and food pairings included) please head on over to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/137449114/bmann">Eventbrite to register now</a>. I fully expect this to sell out as we push out the word this week, so get your tickets soon.</p>

<p>We're also looking for <a href="http://vinocamp.com/vinocamp-sponsors">sponsors</a> and <a href="http://vinocamp.com/vinocamp-speakers">speakers</a>. </p>

<p>Thanks to launch sponsors <a href="http://redwerks.com">Redwerks</a> for helping put together the website with their <a href="http://kommonwealth.com">Kommonwealth</a> tool, and to Artisan Wine Company for being the wine sponsor.</p>

<p>And, of course, a tip of the corkscrew in the general direction of my co-organizers: <a href="http://ethniceats.ca">Degan</a>, <a href="http://netchick.ca">Tanya</a>, <a href="http://typeapr.com">Colleen</a>, <a href="http://megancole.org">Megan</a>, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100115/">Cyprien</a> and <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/">Lauren</a> (yes there are some <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice</a> co-conspirators in that list).</p>

<p>* For the record, the WineCamp one liner description is "an ad-hoc gathering that brings together the best of the old world and the new... wine, non-profits and geeks!" -- connecting non-profits with technologists over wine. A great goal, but we really were interested in reaching out to wine and food enthusiasts and skip technology all together -- aside</p>
