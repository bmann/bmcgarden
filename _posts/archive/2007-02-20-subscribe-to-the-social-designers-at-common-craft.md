<p>If you read Lee LeFever&#39;s <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Common Craft</a> website, I&#39;ve been discussing a lot of things with him, as evidenced by a couple of nice &quot;so I was talking to Boris the other day and...&quot; links he&#39;s thrown my way.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in or in any way intersect social software and/or online community, you should be subscribed to Common Craft.</p><p>What is it? They have a little note that says Common Craft &quot;is a consulting practice and weblog operated by Lee and Sachi LeFever.  The focus of Common Craft is Social Design for the Web.&quot; I like that phrase: Social Design for the Web. Which makes Lee and Sachi &quot;Social Designers&quot;.</p><p>Most recently, we <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/001328.html">talked about Dell&#39;s IdeaStorm</a>, which is a Salesforce AppExchange component made by <a href="http://www.crispyideas.com/global/ideas">CrispyIdeas</a>. The big thing here is that the underlying technology of &quot;social software&quot; is being commoditized. Now comes the hard part: understanding and utilizing the technology in the context of engaging your community. </p><p>Before that I asked Lee if he felt he was a <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/001311.html">member of Flickr&#39;s community</a>. I used to be a member of the Flickr community, waaay back in the old days when it was just getting started. But I don&#39;t think I can call myself that now: it&#39;s &quot;just&quot; a place to put pictures. I&#39;ve moved out of the active 1% and in to the &quot;just use it&quot; 9%.</p><p>There&#39;s lots of technology out there: I spend more and more time thinking about the soft underbelly that&#39;s all about people.&nbsp;</p>
