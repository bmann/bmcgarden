I finally got around to changing my <a href="http://www.geourl.org">GeoURL</a> coordinates.

That green button labelled GeoURL on the left will now take you to a list of sites that have put their latitude and longitude on their site (or individual postings), and that are within 100 miles of my address here.

Also, GeoURL now offers an RSS feed, so I added the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/import/feed/91" title="GeoURL Feed for sites within 75 miles">feed for sites within 75 miles</a>. Why 75? 100 miles started adding ones near Seattle.

Here's my <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/162">original post</a> about GeoURL. I've been using <a href="http://www.multimap.com">MultiMap</a> lately to get lat/longs.
