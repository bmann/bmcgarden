<blockquote>
It used to be that we thought we needed to pretty up the web so people would use it. Those days are long gone. Today's web user is after a meaningful experience, not just a good time, and has little need for adornments. Maybe it's because we've grown up some: the technology, and those who use it. I can now see that the beauty of the web lies in its function, not its form, and I would rather that my sites attract attention because they are widely useful and usable than because they are pretty.
