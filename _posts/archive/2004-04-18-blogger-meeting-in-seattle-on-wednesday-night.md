<blockquote><p>I'll try to get to the <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00001727.html">Blogger Meetup in Seattle on Wednesday evening</a>. Things I like about this meetup is 1) Anita Rowland is there (I think of it as Anita's meetup) 2) Everyone is welcome. 3) It's in a low-cost venue so no one needs to dig deep in their pockets. 4) There's always a good geek quotient (and lots of people I've never met before, I like meeting new people). 5) You don't need to be a geek to come and there usually are non-geeks there as well, so my wife has more fun too 6) Usually there are people there who don't blog, either. It's lots of fun, something for everyone.</p>

<p>Ain't going to make it to this one. The Vancouver weblog meetup is cancelled -- going to do some promotion ahead of the next one. It seems like <a href="http://www.meetup.com">MeetUp.com</a> doesn't get used as much here in Canada. I've been trying to switch all my subscriptions to Vancouver from Ottawa, and the new "pay us money now!" links that are everywhere <em>really</em> annoy me, to the point where I'm ready to give up.</p>

<p>In any case, I'm going to keep my eye on the Seattle stuff, and make a trip down there at some point, hopefully with some of the <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com" title="Urban Vancouver News">Urban Vancouver.com</a> crew in tow. It's only about 2-3hrs.</p>

<p>Mmm...<a href="http://www.urbanseattle.com">this is taken</a>, albeit with a big Flash movie that doesn't load in Safari.</p>
