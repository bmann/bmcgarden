<p>I'm going to be interviewed by Global TV in a few hours, talking about citizen journalism and how people in the streets of London began documenting the recent events there practically in real time, using cell phones and digital cameras.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> will likely feature prominently,  even though they're not technically a Vancouver company anymore. I'm going to use this post to gather links, and I did a little pre-show practice with the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/sites/bmannconsulting.com/files/Global.mp4" rel="enclosure">attached movie</a>.</p>

<p>All the links after the jump. I'll update as I know more, please do send in examples of more coverage (leave a comment or just link to this post).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the interview is done, <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=609">covered nicely by Kris</a>. He took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/24532577/">pictures</a>, too. I'm pretty happy with how it went -- there was a lot to cover, so hopefully I gave a little taste of what's available, and what that means for covering current events like the events in London.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I didn't manage to watch the 6pm news, but got calls from friends and relatives who saw it. From all accounts, it went pretty well, although my segment was quite short. I tuned in to the 11pm news to see if I could see it myself....but <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/">Joey deVilla scooped me</a>! Not really, but it looks like they cut together a different segment based on footage from the Toronto office. One more chance some time tomorrow, I think.</p><p><b>Update 3:</b> <a href="http://www.moosehat.com/">Stewart Marshall</a> sent along a bunch of relevant links --</p>
