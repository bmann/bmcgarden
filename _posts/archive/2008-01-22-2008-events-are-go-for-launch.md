<p>Having just come back from the <a href="http://foundersandfunders.org">Founders and Funders Dinner in Toronto</a>, it's time to get ready for the big <a href="http://www.launchpartyhq.com/check-it-launch-party-vancouver-3">Launch Party Vancouver 3</a> event this Friday. Maura and crew have pulled this together in record time, and it looks like Sun is going to be doing a big kickoff. What with the purchase of MySQL and supporting local tech communities like this, I'm getting more and more interested in looking closely at Sun.</p>

<p>Then, in 2 weeks time, we're doing <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver05">DemoCamp Vancouver 05</a>. I'll get the Facebook event sent out today, so watch for that. We need both battledeck submissions and people to demo...fill out the wiki or <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>Then it's <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/">Web Directions North</a> next week, which I'll be <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/speaking-web-directions-north-08-three-stages-content-management">speaking at</a>.</p>

<p>Whew! 2008 events are off with a bang. Here's some other stuff I'm tracking -- in no way complete or comprehensive.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thirdtuesdayvancouver.com/">Third Tuesday Vancouver</a> is up on January 29th, starring Brian Oberkirch</li>
<li>the inaugural <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=19415890596">NetSquared Net Tuesday</a> on February 5th</li>
<li>the second <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=7237202028">Ajax and Beer</a> that krazy koder Brian Leroux is putting on February 6th (yes, that is going to be one crazy week)</li>
<li>the wonderful <a href="http://www.eatcomm.ca/">Cinci Csere</a> is pulling together <a href="http://www.casecamp.org/home/show/CaseCampVancouver3">CaseCampVancouver3</a> -- an unconference for marketers (aka "case studies") on February 20th<li>
<li>don't forget! <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice 2008</a> is coming at the end of February...I am *so* looking forward to this...</li>
<li>Duane is thinking we should do a <a href="http://duanestorey.com/2008/01/14/beer-camp/">Startup Weekend in Vancouver</a> -- he's thinking early April right now</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll likely come back and update that event list in a bit...</p>
