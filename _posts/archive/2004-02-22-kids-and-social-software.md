Foe "leads identity product development at BBCi" :</p>
<blockquote>
My motivation is to ensure that children continue to have the right to be present in public; to enjoy the benefits of social software and the good social capital it can generate, and to have a public voice. Digital spaces are particularly important given the social context in the UK, where a child playing freely outside is less common and teens donâ€™t feel welcome in public space.

<p>I've got a potential project brewing that involves kids, families, health, and fitness. I continue to be interested in the potential of the "publishing web" to allow everyday people to connect, create communities, and share information.</p>

<p>There is such an overwhelming amount of factual information available on the Internet, but not so much on how to apply that information to everyday life. Sharing information in a more experiential- or story-based way might make it easier for people to relate and actually integrate into their lives.</p>
