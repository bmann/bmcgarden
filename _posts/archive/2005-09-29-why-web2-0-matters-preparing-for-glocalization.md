Goes on my list of "must read" articles about shifting nature of Web 2.0, from Danah's unique perspective at the intersection of social science, academia, and technology.

<blockquote>
<p>Buzzwords associated with Web2.0 include: remix, tagging, hackability, social networks, open APIs, microcontent, personalization. People discuss how the web is moving from a read-only system to a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002434.php">read/write system</a> and they focus on technologies like GreaseMonkey, Ajax, RSS/Atom, Ruby on Rails.  Of course, others talk about the <a href="http://www.abstractdynamics.org/archives/2005/08/27/web_20.html">paradoxical relationship between openness and control</a>. The reality is that when people talk about Web2.0, they're talking about a political affiliation with The Next Cool Thing, even if no one has a clue what it is yet.</p>

<p>Personally, i don't find comfort in any of the business, technological or experiential explanations. Yet, i do believe that a shift is occurring and i find myself emotionally invested in it. So then i had to ask myself: what is Web2.0 and why does it matter? The answer is glocalization.</p>
