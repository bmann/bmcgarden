Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> is already seeing lots of Widgets being created, like those found over at <a href="http://www.thedashboarder.com/">The Dashboarder</a>.

Looking through the <a href="http://www.thedashboarder.com/forums/">forums</a>, I found a link to <a href="http://www.designasaur.com/gadgets/">some widget mockups</a> developed by a graphic designer.

I think this is what Apple was targeting: make the barrier to entry for creating applications very low, and you'll see all sorts of useful little things being created.
