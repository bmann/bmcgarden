<p>...you're on the phone with <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/">Jonathan</a> fitting in a conversation on the way to lunch, can't put down the phone even when you're shaking hands with <a href="http://blame.ca/dick/">Dick</a>, and then finally you have to hang up on the aforementioned Jonathan of <a href="http://www.firebright.com" title="Advanced hosting and provisioning of open source tools">Firebright</a> because you're meeting <a href="http://chuqui.typepad.com/">Chuq</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>Or maybe I'm just a jerk with a cellphone. In any case, sorry to all involved. It <strong>was</strong> great meeting <a href="http://chuqui.typepad.com">Chuq</a> and Laurie. Roland is the center point for the International Brotherhood of Blogging Foodies, and we enjoyed lunch at the Boss, a great Hong Kong style diner in Vancouver's Chinatown.</p>

<p>Lots of <a href="http://www.whatsweb20.com">Web 2.0</a> conversation, as well as foodie topics and 1 Infinite Loop. Nope, didn't find out anything, other than Chuq is crucial to success.</p>
