<p>VersionTracker had the CVS release of <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> show up in the RSS feed that I read. I admit, I never really considered Asterisk on the Mac platform. <a href="http://scottstuff.net/scott/archives/000227.html">Scott</a> points out that Asterisk just posted their first 1.0 <acronym title="Release Candidate">RC</acronym>. I guess you could use an external interface rather one of the internal <a href="http://www.digium.com">Digium</a> products: they do have the <a href="http://www.digium.com/index.php?menu=iaxy">IAXy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> OK, this is definitely an OS X version of Asterisk, since some <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24031">AppleScripts for managing it</a> also got released. The company behind this is <a href="http://www.sunrise-tel.com/">Sunrise Telephone Systems</a>, based out of Japan. They have some impressive GUI config screenshots for OS X up ("Macsterisk"). Now I'm excited!</p>
