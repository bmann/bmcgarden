<p>This was originally part of my <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/barcamp-vancouver-2007-wrap>BarCamp Vancouver 2007 wrap up post</a>, but that turned into a monster and this is really about what's next.</p>

<p>So, you're still flying high on the good vibes from BarCamp Vancouver, and you're trying to figure out "What next?". Some things to watch for...</p>

<p>A <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">DemoCamp Vancouver</a> event some time in mid September. Need to spend some time talking to <a href="http://techvibesblog.com">Rob Lewis / TechVibes</a> about helping out with organizing these...I'm trying to shed as many organizing roles as I can, while still promoting / attending / etc. I love all this stuff, but it don't pay the bills...</p>

<p>Also on the plate....when are we going to do a <a href="http://www.startupweekend.com/">Startup Weekend</a> (once again, <a href="http://techvibesblog.com/startup-weekend-in-vancouver/">nod to TechVibes for kicking off discussion</a>)? Late October, maybe right after a sort of "organizing" DemoCamp Vancouver on the Thursday before? This may ideally be the kickoff for a new take on the Innovation Commons that I hinted at in my other post.</p>
