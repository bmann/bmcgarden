I thought the really cool thing was actually <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&comment=2796#1348">a well-reasoned, very descriptive comment</a> to Scoble's blog item. For me, that's what intertwingling is all about -- this interconnectedness of comments and meta-comments, with blogs pointing every which way, and tangental thought streams being sparked off by the community gathered around any particular firepit that is a single blog. Heh. I guess those would be called "smoke signals" if you want to continue the metaphor...
