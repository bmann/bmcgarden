<a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/usr/18">Todd</a> sent me an email with a link to the <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/ShowPlace.asp?PlaceID=1060">JIJ's Schnitzel House entry at RateBeer.com</a>. Featuring a picture of Kate and I from last year.

Actually, the <a href="http://www.jijschnitzel.com/pages/3/index.htm">JIJ site</a> has a bunch of pictures of people we know. <a href="http://gallery.bmannconsulting.com/sep26_jij_oktoberfest">Our gallery</a> includes the picture on the RateBeer site -- I don't know who put it up there, but I imagine it came up from a Google search.

By the way, when Todd isn't <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/18" title="Todd Bailey's Blog">asking questions here</a>, he's over at the RateBeer site. <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=6162" title="Todd Bailey's alter-ego on RateBeer">Cap Flu</a> is his handle there. And look -- there's even a beer called <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/ShowBeer.asp?BeerID=26942&FanOfID=6162">Boris</a>.
