<blockquote>
â€¦success in future is increasingly defined by non-network attributes. Your ability to cheaply acquire and rapidly provision customers; to accurately manage the credit you extend; pro-actively seek out and destroy the root causes of customer care costs; excel at billing and collections; juggle your finances better than anyone else; perfectly tailor handset, spectrum and network supply chain management and inventory to demand; ramrod a few bundled third party communication services onto the bill; and so on. Anything to snatch and hold on to uppity churnaphilic customers.
