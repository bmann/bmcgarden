<p>We finally got our new (business) cellphones yesterday. We all have <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/english/products/3590.asp">Nokia 3590s</a>. So far, all the ring tones are intensely annoying. Apparently one can send MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services) -- a.k.a. messages with pictures and/or sound attached. So, have to find some non-annoying ringtones and figure out how to mail them to the phone. Voice-dialing is kind of cool -- you just hit a button and speak a name that you've previously associated with a number, and it will dial. Since I have a cold right now, it will be interesting to see if these "voice tags" still work when my cold is gone. I accidentally started the browser (the phone uses GPRS) -- it is brutally slow, I can't see how anyone uses the Internet on their phones... The phone has Java support, too. I'm going to look into that, see if I can get some of my own apps on there. My business partners and I have long talked about running an app on our PDAs or cell phones that would let us track our activities. Here's the <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/english/products/user_manuals/3590.pdf">online version of the 3590 user guide</a>. The dead tree version is hard to find stuff in. Cool -- <a href="http://www.myphonegames.co.uk/">the Brits are selling games for phones</a>. Hmmm...looking for some free ringtones. Still don't quite know how to get them into the phone. <a href="http://www.gomobile.ca/index.htm">These guys</a> are Canadian and say they'll give me one free tone. Enough for now -- off for breakfast at the El Morocco.</p>
