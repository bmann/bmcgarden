<p style="">So, before I had a chance (it has been too long) to point to <a href="http://bryan.yiibu.com/2005/07/update-from-bangkok.html" style="">Bryan's update from Bangkok</a>, he and <a href="http://steph.nmadness.com/" style="">Steph</a> are coming back to Vancouver.</p>  <p style="">Can't say I'm disappointed that SE Asia didn't have enough allure for them -- I'm going to need more help in getting the &quot;Innovation Commons&quot; off the ground here in Vancouver.
