<blockquote>
The Peer Distributed Transfer Protocol, or PDTP, is a project to define a replacement for the venerable FTP protocol.  PDTP is similar to BitTorrent in the way it handles distributed streams, but also manages a directory hierarchy automatically and includes other interesting features such as <a href="http://pdtp.org/static/rdl.html">metadata rich directory listings</a> and support for file integrity validation through the use of DSS signatures.  The project proposes <a href="http://pdtp.org/static/networks.html">three use cases</a> for increasing scale.

<p><em>If</em> PDTP gets going, it looks like it could rival BitTorrent. I'm all for getting rid of FTP as soon as possible. For BitTorrent, we probably still need a "nice" option that lets you specify a percentage of bandwidth to useâ€¦I need some left over to make and receive VoIP calls!</p>
