<p>Recall the <a href="/blog/bmann/stop-with-the-guest-posting-already">rant I had on guest posting</a>. I was recently looking at my <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOm</a> subscribtion again, and was preparing to get all pissy about not being able to subscribe just to Om Malik.</p><p>Except, of course, since they&#39;re using Wordpress and have actually set up separate authors, it&#39;s actually built in functionality.</p><p>So, if you want to read all posts by Om, just subscribe to this feed: <a href="http://gigaom.com/?feed=rss2&amp;author=om-malik">http://gigaom.com/?feed=rss2&amp;author=om-malik</a><br /></p><p>I feel so much happier now that I can have Om delivered just for me. That&#39;s not to say that postings by <a href="http://gigaom.com/author/liz-gannes/">Liz Gannes</a> et al aren&#39;t good (quite the opposite, in fact). But in my mind, the mixing of author posts was diluting the &quot;voice&quot; that I heard from Om. Not having interacted with the other authors as much, it will take me more time to recognize their voice and style as belonging to a particular person. Otherwise, it&#39;s just news.<br /></p>
