<p>[Cross-posted from the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/innovation-commons-first-meeting-notes-next-event">wiki</a>]</p>  <p>Well, things are well and truly moving. I didn't get around to posting a wrap up of the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/events/innovation-commons-brainstorming-session-sep-2005">October 5th meeting</a> -- Roland <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/10/05/innovation_commons_first_meeting_was_tonight_and_it_was_fantastic">made a post</a> and also took a bunch of pictures on Flickr -- just check the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/innovationcommons">innovation commons</a> tag.</p>  <p>Suffice it to say, we had about 20 plus people show up, <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com">Take 5</a> stayed open late to let us hang out, and there was a great discussion on what people wanted out of this here in Vancouver. The main take away: let's do this thing, and what can we do to make it happen.</p> <!--break--> <p>Troy Angrignon connected the effort with Charles Holmes (who did a great job of adding some analyses to the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/innovation-commons">wiki</a>), and is briefing Cindy Pearson of the <a href="http://www.bctia.org/">BC Technologies Industry Association</a> this evening.</p>  <p>The other big &quot;snowball&quot; item was a contact from <a href="http://bad.typepad.com">Bill MacEwen</a>. Apparently, Bill had actually been working on a local Innovation Commons concept for the past few months, and is a lot farther along in terms of business plans, looking at locations, etc. Bill is going to present at the next meeting to get us caught up -- he posted some details about his <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/workspace-cafe">Workspace Cafe</a> to the wiki.</p>  <p>I'm out of town for the next week, so I'm going to suggest <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/events/innovation-commons-second-meeting">October 26th for the next meeting</a>. I'm sure I'll get feedback if this interferes with a hockey game or other event that I'm not cool enough to know about. As usual, adding your name to the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/innovation-commons-supporters">supporters list</a> and filling in more information on the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/innovation-commons">wiki</a> is how you can continue to help. The list of <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/possible-names">names</a> was another big discussion -- add some more, then we'll run a poll at some point.</p>  <p>Thanks to Nik and Elicia from the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/wiki/newenterprisedevelopment">New Enterprise Development team</a> for putting up with the wide ranging discussion. Some of that material is going to make it's way in to a survey which we're going to ask people to fill out and help promote.</p>
