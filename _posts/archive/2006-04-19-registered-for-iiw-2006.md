<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/04/iiw_gear_availa.shtml">Phil Windley asked me to register for IIW 2006</a>, so I did. See you in San Francisco in a couple of weeks...</p>  <blockquote> If you&#39;re planning on coming to IIW May 1-3, I&#39;d really appreciate you <a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006a/register">registering</a> as soon as possible so that we can use reasonably good numbers for planning food for breaks, etc.   </blockquote>  <p>But, Phil, <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/iiw2005">CafePress</a>? With a deprecated 2005 URL? Come on, everyone knows the new kid on the block is <a href="http://www.goodstorm.com">GoodStorm</a> -- capitalism done right. Shirts start at $5.95US for a &quot;Good&quot; quality white shirt with no markup.</p>  <p>Disclaimer: <a href="http://www.bryght.com">we&#39;ve</a> been working with the GoodStorm guys. I&#39;ve got a <a href="https://www.goodstorm.com/stores/boris">test store</a> that you can order a <a href="https://www.goodstorm.com/item/boris/meat">meat t-shirt</a> from if you like. For a mere $7US! Hopefully, a new version will be Identity 2.0 enabled.</p>
