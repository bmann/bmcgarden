<p>Referencing Caterina&#39;s <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000965.html">It&#39;s a bad time to start a company</a> list, <a href="http://anisotropic.net/caterinas_take_on_starting_a_company_in_the_valley">Jeff Griffiths</a> figures that being in Vancouver actually helped with Flickr&#39;s success beyond the not-in-the-valley stealth mode that being in Canada imparts:</p> <blockquote> I would go even further and say that one of the critical success factors for Flickr *was* that they were not just &#39;toiling in obscurity&#39;, but that they were IN Vancouver. Up here we have lots of talent, a relatively low cost of living ( compared to the valley at least ), and all sorts of added lifestyle bonuses that San jose will never beat ( climbing / biking / snowboarding / music ).<br /><br />And for Flickr in particular, a major part of their early success was a loyal local following of users; witness the hugeness of the Vancouver tag. I would smugly theorize that Flickr&#39;s ability to find their users was helped in a large way by their being in Vancouver, a city that seems to breed tech-obsessed shutterbugs more than most places.<br /><br />I dunno, I think it&#39;s probably a bad time to start a company in San Jose, but it&#39;s hard to say when that would ever be true given Caterina&#39;s qualifications. Vancouver, on the other hand, seems to be a fine place to ( re ) start a company... </blockquote>  <p>Jeff is currently toiling in obscurity over at the newly re-vivified <a href="http://www.activestate.com">Active State</a>. They&#39;ve got new offices lined up in the UK Building right above our de-facto Innovation Commons at <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com">Take 5 Cafe</a>.</p>  <p>Re: talent. This is one of my major concerns: make it clear to worldwide talent that Vancouver is a great place to live (not hard) and that there are lots of companies doing interesting things here (harder). This is something I&#39;ve talked at length with Zak Greant of <a href="http://ez.no">EZ Systems</a>, who&#39;s in the process of getting a larger <a href="http://ez.no/company/ez_crew/north_america">EZ presence</a> set up here in Van-groovy. Looks like he&#39;s still looking for a <a href="http://zak.greant.com/ez-systems-north-america-wants-you/">Sales Director and a Senior Project Manager</a> (Matt Everard, the project manager position is one that would be a good fit for you...bug Zak about it).</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/">Andre</a> said something about wanting some more AJAX-y JavaScript experts for <a href="http://ebusiness-apps.com/">eBusiness Apps, makers of fine AJAX components</a>. And you&#39;ll probably learn how to take Fridays off and go skiing.</p>  <p>The guys at <a href="http://www.thelevel.com/">The Level</a> combine many of my most <strike>hated</strike> distasteful words: Java, Enterprise, Portal, and Proprietary. BUT, I met with them the other day, they have a killer office looking out over the Granville/Burrard bridges, are great guys, and are working on some seriously cool stuff. Java/XSLT experts, <a href="http://www.thelevel.com/careers">apply within</a>.</p>  <p>Identity 2.0? <a href="http://www.sxip.com/careers">SXIP has work</a>.</p>  <p>So, just a selection of cool Vancouver companies doing interesting, cutting edge stuff -- I&#39;m sure there are more. Now all we need is a Sun research center overseen by <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim</a> and <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a>, or maybe a Google North.</p>  <p>Move up to Vancouver and start a company, already! (or join one of the ones above).</p> <!--break-->
