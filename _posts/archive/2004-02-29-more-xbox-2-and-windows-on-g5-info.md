<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/654" title="B. Mann Consulting: IBM to build chips for XBox 2">XBox 2 being powered by G5s</a>, then more recently threw out an off-hand remark about <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/863" title="B. Mann Consulting: Media Server = Consumer Electronics = Sony should buy Apple">Microsoft developing XBox2 on G5s</a>. Except that wasn't apparently confirmed yet. <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=14407" title="The Inquirer: Xbox 2 SDK released on cool Apple Power Mac G5s">The Inquirer</a> confirms it, with details of the XBox 2 <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym>:</p>

<blockquote>
The big news to us is that the XBOX 2 SDK has been seeded to developers on dual Apple Power Mac G5 systems running a custom Windows NT Kernel.

<p>My other recent post about the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/871" title="B. Mann Consulting: Does speed advantage mean Mac tipping point?">Mac speed advantage</a>, where I talked about Microsoft possibly porting Windows to PPC, now doesn't seem so crazy anymore. The tie-in with Virtual PC and a lot of similar thinking is covered nicely by <a href="http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2004/02/xbox2_g5hellipa.html" title="XBox2, G5...and Virtual PC?
">eclecticism</a>, home of Michael Hanscom, the (former) Microsoft employee that got fired for taking pictures of G5s on the loading dock.</p>

<p>I don't quite know what to say. Microsoft porting to PPC would have seemed inconceivable not that long ago.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the <a href="http://apple.weblogsinc.com/entry/6425655111144188/">Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> has an IBM memo that seems to be saying that the Apple G5 <em>might</em> have used Intel chips.</p>
