<p style=""><a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com" style="">Colin</a> mentioned an excellent use case for <a href="http://www.microformats.org" style="">microformats</a> to me: a standardized way of displaying information about music, most likely a direct one-to-one relation in XHTML of the <a href="http://www.id3.org/" style="">ID3</a> data that is embedded in MP3 files today.</p>  <p style="">Since audio files are binary files, in many cases quite huge, having basic crawlers parse them to get this ID3 would introduce a ton of overhead. Having this available in a human-readable way that is also parse-able would be great.</p>  <p style="">I'm sure Colin will expand on this mini-post (nudge, nudge). <strong>Update:</strong> He did - <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com/technology/2005/09/micro-formats-and-audio-peanut-butter-and-chocolate/">Micro formats and audio = peanut butter and chocolate</a></p>
