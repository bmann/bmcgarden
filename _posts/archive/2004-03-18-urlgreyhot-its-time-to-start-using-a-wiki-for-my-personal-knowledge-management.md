I started typing a long response to urlgreyhot's <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/drupal/node/view/1513">It's time to start using a wiki for my personal knowledge management</a> , and then realized I needed to capture it here, since it is a kind of rationalization for myself of the different technologies I've been using. And he doesn't have <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/trackback">trackback</a> turned on, so I can't post here but still let him know.

I found myself involved in a bunch of different projects, all of which I had to start gathering knowledge for. The problems are somewhat the same -- the structure of Drupal makes it a bit harder for ad-hoc information gathering. On to my solutionâ€¦
<!--break-->
I already run a couple of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blogs, so I ended up setting one up to use for a <a href="http://links.bmannconsulting.com">links blog</a>. The best thing I find about it is the bookmarklet, where I can highlight some text on any page, then just hit a link in my toolbar, check off a few categories, and boom! -- a new entry. And, I can still syndicate the links blog back onto my main page using RSS.

I actually think that adding bookmarklet support to Drupal's weblinks module would probably be enough for me. I'm in the process of splitting my <a href="http://boris.bmannconsulting.com" title="Boris Mann's Personal Blog">personal</a> and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com" title="B. Mann Consulting - Search Engine Voodoo, Information Architecture, VoIP">business</a> blogs completely, and will likely implement this for the business one.

However, lots of other people have also reported success with using an external service like <a href="http://www.furl.net">Furl</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us/</a> (again using RSS to syndicate back).

That was a long way of saying that you may find yourself addicted to Drupal -- I know I am!
