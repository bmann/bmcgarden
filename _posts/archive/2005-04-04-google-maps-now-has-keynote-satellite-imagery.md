<p>So, Google Maps continues to blow my mind, or as <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/archives/002911.html">Kellan says, to &quot;make an already amazing service jaw dropping&quot;</a>. Everyone else will be linking to it in one form or another, of course, but gives me a chance to post a picture of my neighbourhood:</p>

<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boris/8483667/"><img width="500" height="272" alt="Map of our house" src="http://photos8.flickr.com/8483667_6845a376cd.jpg" /></a>

<p>I've said that I believe that this is the year of maps and calendars. <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a> says it's the year of photo sharing for a wider segment of people, and he's right as well: I tend to think about what's new and different and done well for the first time. For photo sharing, we hit that peak last year with Flickr already.</p>

<p>In any case....maps and calendars, you heard it here first. Also gives me a chance to link to the newly relaunched <a href="http://www.geourl.org">GeoURL 2.0</a>, complete with <a href="http://geourl.org/news/">weblog</a>.</p>

<p>I didn't know, but GeoURL was actually originally put together by Joshua Schachter, creator of <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> (who has quit his job and is working on it full time).</p>

<p>I happen to think that tagging is not that difficult of an application. Granted, it is easy to say now with del.icio.us as an example. Meta-tags, yeah, that's the ticket...</p>
