posting with Safari on 10.2.3. This is much faster that 10.1.5 ever was. Wow.

I like Safari. I will post lots more about this on my webspace later.
Right now, what I want to know is how do I make Safari save my login and password for various sites I use?? So far it seems to not have a password management system?!? Aren't these things pretty much required these days??
Post followups if you know what ta do!
