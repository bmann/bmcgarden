<p>Last night I ended up staying at the <a href="http://www.strutta.com" title="Strutta is online video competition">Strutta</a> offices until the wee hours of the morning, cheering the team on as they worked towards their launch today.</p>

<p>I worked with Jordan Behan to do a fun <a href="http://www.strutta.com/video/behan-spoofs-arrington">spoof of Michael Arrington</a> (and yes, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/15/strutta-im-the-best-around-nothings-ever-gonna-bring-me-down/">Strutta got a TechCrunch posting</a>) -- I did the Fox news guy voice over. The posting from Jordan is, of course, meant to kick off a <a href="http://www.strutta.com/play/best-michael-arrington-impression">competition for the best Michael Arrington impression</a>. Personally, I think someone should get out the sock puppets... :P</p>

<p>We actually ended up dragging <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/">Kevin Marks</a> back to the Strutta HQ, in town for <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/">Open Web Vancouver</a>. It was great catching up with him in his new role as Developer Advocate at Google -- oh, and a kick ass paper airplane folder, so I expect him and his sons to <a href="http://www.strutta.com/play/paper-airplane">compete in the Strutta best paper airplane round</a>. Kevin, you wanted me to complain about Google's messed up identity system -- I did this <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/googles-identity-infrastructure-is-messed-up-and-no-one-is-talking">last January</a> and some pieces are better, but the big thing is that I can't use any of my Google Apps for Domains accounts to sign into Google Groups. Since I don't want to use my personal Gmail account to be on random mailing list, this seriously hampers me pretty much every single day. Please fix :P</p>

<p>Congrats to the Strutta team, I know you've got some Beta Bug-lets, but looks like people are having a lot of fun. We've been amusing ourselves flipping the little Flash widgets back and forth -- there are lots of nice touches like this all over the site.</p>

<p>P.S. Yes, it's Drupal. And, oh, look it's multi-lingual: I predict many more interesting multi-lingual sites as people focus beyond North America.</p>
