<p>Wow. My last post over a week ago, and that only a &quot;Links of Interest&quot;. Well, Easter was in between, and I did get a chance to try a Segway, among lots of work stuff.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the <a alt="Community and Content Management Hosting" href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght</a> crew (including <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris Krug</a>, the newest addition), is going to be at <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/massive">MASSIVE</a>, a local Vancouver technology tradeshow and exhibition.</p>

<p>Roland <a href="http://www.bryght.com/bryght-radio/massive-2005-preview">interviewed me about Massive</a>. Just a short practice run, really -- I'll likely get recorded again when we head over to Subeez for the <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=275">second Vancouver BeerCasting</a>.</p>

<p>If you stop by (we're at Booth #229, in the Peer1 Pipeline), you can also see my <a title="PowerMac G5 and BenQ DV2680" href="/node/1437">new TV</a>, which we're using as our booth demo.</p>
