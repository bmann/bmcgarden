<p>An excellent description of what a wiki is, and what it's used for, all in non-technical terms. Todd <a href="/node/view/1036">asked about wikis in the forum here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
Ultimately, a wiki is a specific type of website.  A wiki is special because it allows a group of people to build, edit and modify a website with no programming or HTML whatsoever.  Because it doesn&rsquo;t require technical expertise, all users of the wiki have equal ability to maintain and edit the site.  Wikis are easy to learn and use, which makes them accessible to everyone.

<p>I also like this section:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Wikis are different from normal web sites:</b></p>

<p>Normal web sites are usually developed offline and then presented to users as a finished product.  By comparison, wikis are first presented to users as a blank slate- an empty page.  A new wiki is an empty wiki, no pages, no links.  Instead of a team of designers developing a web site in private, a wiki is developed in public by the users of the wiki over the life of the wiki. </p>
