<p>This is a "mention map" of people and hashtags that I mention on Twitter. You can <a href="http://asterisq.com/blog/2010/07/08/embed-mentionmap-in-your-website">get your own embed code</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://asterisq.com">Asterisq</a> is a local Vancouver company that is doing really interesting things with data visualization. Data visualization is an increasingly hot area, going from "neat!" to "wow, I would never have had this insight without seeing it like this".</p>
<p>The guys at Asterisq are looking for big data sets and partners to work with, so contact them if this sounds interesting. They've got a <a href="http://asterisq.com/products/constellation/custom/implementations">gallery of some other custom implementations of graphs</a>. Bonus points for <a href="http://asterisq.com/blog/2009/08/31/editable-graph-visualization-for-csis">Drupal integration</a> and also some <a href="http://asterisq.com/blog/2009/05/15/ultimate-movie-site-using-framework-for-facebook">Facebook integration</a>.</p>
