Ideas, social media, intense thinking, tossing around concepts, learning from everyone, lots of fun, beer, eats, etc. etc.</p>  <p>Feedback and thoughts in no particular order.</p> <!--break--> <ol> <li>we didn&#39;t do a good job of kicking off BarCamp with the straight-to-the-bar party on Friday night; there was no announcement, it really was just a party to drink at...let&#39;s move this to the day after? not sure... </li><li>the &quot;Camp&quot; aspect of doing stuff overnight is really important for cranking stuff out -- how do we do this better? I flubbed as much as anyone and just needed to go home and crash (see point #1) plus giving <a href="http://scottstuff.net">Scott</a> a comfortable place to sleep for the night</li> <li>follow on again from last point: needs for hacking code together are different than talking about ideas in sessions...maybe stamp the night with the SuperHappyDevHouse moniker (plus social media project creation? I love having artifacts to show...), and then have set aside time in the tracks for everyone to demo</li> <li>My Geo presentation was very unprepared, which I apologize for -- it was supposed to be in the afternoon, and I ended up being computerless in the morning...I&#39;ve put up <a href="http://barcamp.org/Geo">notes on Geo on the wiki</a>, hope that helps -- don&#39;t forget to <a href="/blog/bmann/want-buy-gps-logging-device">leave a comment if you want to bulk buy a GPS logger</a></li> <li>I like wearing a cowboy hat and my rockin&#39; sleeveless &quot;Boris&quot; t-shirt</li> <li>I&#39;ve still got more thinking to do about helping / assisting / developing / connecting something that feels a bit like an advertising and/or blogging network; spent some time musing to <a href="http://www.miss604.com">Miss604</a> and <a href="http://www.telltenfriends.com">Jordan Behan</a> about this; <a href="http://www.b5media.com/">b5</a>, is this you? We need to talk...</li> <li>I had *so* *much* *fun* in James&#39; session on DIY advertising. Yes, it&#39;s all an evil plan as part of <a href="http://www.adhack.com">Ad Hack</a>...but getting groups of people together, falling into different roles, and then producing a video advertising a product in one hour....rocked. I&#39;ll need to dedicate a whole post to my team, &quot;Vice Ads&quot;, who produced the <a href="http://www.unclefatihspizza.com">Share a Fatih</a> video... (see <a href="http://adhack.com/site/comments/diy-advertising-in-60-minutes-or-less/">James&#39; post on all three videos)<br /></a></li> <li>I flubbed collaborating with Duane on <a href="http://www.mycallmonster.com">MyCallMonster</a>...he did more hacking, we have a project space set up, stay tuned. What is it? Tagline: eating your voicemail so you don&#39;t have to. In a couple of weeks, ditch your cellphone voicemail and get voicemail via email and more for the same price...<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mycallmonster">Sign up</a> if you&#39;re interested. </li> <li><a href="http://www.canadabombshell.ca/?p=55">Megan Cole was missed</a> ... sheesh, I haven&#39;t seen the girl in ages. Red wine when you return? (Note: that link goes to Canada Bombshell...a group blog to highlight coolness in Canada&#39;s New Media sector...subscribe to it, it&#39;s good)</li> <li>I&#39;m recycling the name &quot;Innovation Commons&quot; along with partner in crime and entrepreneur extraordinaire  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyrobinson">Danny Robinson</a> (aside: dude, when the hell are you going to get a blog up? :P) to accelerate startups in Vancouver -- we socialized the idea among some developer / entrepreneur types that wandered by...yep, this is also in need of an entire blog post(s)</li> <li>I&#39;ve wanted to get more involved with <a href="http://freegeekvancouver.org/" title="Ethical Computer Recycling in Vancouver">Free Geek Vancouver</a> -- I really dig the people and I believe in their ideals. But: I&#39;m not a hardcore hardware guy. So? The Free Geek Vancouver Wireless Cadre. We had an ad hoc session and talked community wireless, mesh networking, Wifidog / <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dogonrails/">DogOnRails</a> (by <a href="http://www.infil00p.org/blog/">Joe Bowser</a> already a FGV member, who brought all the actual wireless knowledge to the session), and various ideas how everything from <a href="http://www2.vcn.bc.ca/">VCN</a> to <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca">Mobile Muse / MUSE3</a> can fund some of this work. This also needs to be a whole post...</li> </ol>  <p>We capped off the day with a trip to New Town Bakery for a shared Chinese meal before everyone headed their separate ways. I&#39;m ripping on the writing here only because I had a Hong Kong Milk Tea. It&#39;s supercharged with caffeine.</p>  <p>No (more) links to the many many many people I connected with. So much fun as always (yes, even with you, Lyal, and no apologies...). I love the people, culture, and energy we create from these events. How to filter / channel these connections into the next project / cause / business / meetup?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>:<br /> Dustin Sacks wrote up some very good <a href="http://randomdude.com/blog/threads/2531-BarCamp-thoughts-and-photos">thoughts on BarCamp Vancouver</a>. I left a comment there on the timing / structure that I want to repeat here: BarCamp could start late morning or early afternoon with a true kick off and three tags once around the room. We might break for lunch right afterwards and then do sessions right after lunch. Sessions would &quot;officially&quot; end at some evening point and there would be ad hoc dinner / cocktail plans, and then return to the space to &quot;camp&quot; as well as clearly labeled hack / develop / create spaces, a la SuperHappyDevHouse but expanding into social media creation and such (all night DIY ads, anyone?). In the morning, we would reconvene, maybe recap sessions and do demos from the previous night&#39;s hacking / creation, then continue with sessions until lunch time. We&#39;d wrap up and clean. This, I think, is a good formula with a wide mix of goals met. I think I&#39;ll make some space on the wiki specifically for discussing / planning / templating this.</p>
