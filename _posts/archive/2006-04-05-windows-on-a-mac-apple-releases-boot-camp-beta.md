<p>I thought that Apple was going to do a big product release of *some* kind on April 1st, their 30th anniversary as a company. But, obviously, releasing <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>, software that lets you easily install Windows XP on your Intel-based Mac, would really have been regarded as a practical joke, so they waited until today.</p><p>Dual-booting is really not that interesting. You don&#39;t really share files, and you can&#39;t switch back and forth without restarting the system and rebooting completely. I&#39;ve been speculating if Apple will actually support <a href="http://www.xensource.com">Xen</a>, an open source virtualization technology that lets you run multiple environments simultaneously. Perhaps Boot Camp is just a start -- Apple has already said that it will be included as part of Mac OS X 10.5, aka Leopard, so perhaps that is when Xen support will be rolled into the base of the operating system.<br /></p><p>I&#39;ll be looking for mentions of Xen as people dig into the details of Boot Camp over the next couple of days.&nbsp;</p>
