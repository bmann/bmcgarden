<p>I just got back today from a long week in Amsterdam, having attended a grand total of 3 conferences: <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/" target="_self">Euro OSCON</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/conference-amsterdam-2005" target="_self">DrupalCon</a>, and <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam" target="_self">BarCamp</a>. I met a huge group of people</p><p>I would like to thank <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/" target="_self">Chris Pirillo</a> (check out his new <a href="http://gada.be" target="_self">gada.be</a> multi-search service) for supporting BarCamp. Chris: wish you could have been there, buddy...we could have worked on our plans for World Domination, and probably gotten pretty close.<br /> </p><p>It didn't quite turn out to be the &quot;hackfest&quot; that my preconceptions led me to believe. Or perhaps the hacking was more of the &quot;hack your brain&quot; kind. More on BarCamp and these other conferences later: one big thing I learned is that I am not very good at creating artifacts while attending conferences. I'm very much in the moment, having intense sessions with people and trying to integrate it all internally. Inserting a computer into the mix means I miss what's happening. Paper seems to work OK for notes (maybe a tablet would, too?)...now I just have to transcribe all the bits and pieces, especially what essentially turned into an interview with <a href="http://ralphm.net/" target="_self">Ralph</a> and <a href="http://mons.net/" target="_self">Edwinn</a> of the Jabber Software Foundation.<br /> </p><p>Did I mention the week ahead was going to be busy? I'll be at the <a href="http://www.vef.org/web/EventDetails.asp?ProductID=86" target="_self">Vancouver Enterprise Forum Web 2.0 event</a> on Tuesday, then Wednesday night is the <a href="http://wiki.bryght.com/events/innovation-commons-second-meeting" target="_self">second meeting for the Innovation Commons</a>, with the various other meetings and activities sprinkled through out the week.<br /> </p>
