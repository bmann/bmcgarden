Since I'm at my parents' place on Bowen Island right now, I started looking for some blogs about the island (mainly because the <a href="http://www.bowenisland.com">island websites suck</a>).

I found <a href="http://www.chriscorrigan.com/miscellany/bijournal/blogger.html">Chris Corrigan's blog</a>, where I also found out about <a href="http://www.blogchalking.tk/">Blogchalking</a>. The concept is much like <a href="http://www.geourl.org">GeoURL</a>, but uses Google to do the heavy lifting. Ideally, putting in descriptive info about location/geography will allow regular Google searches to be able to find people that are online, near you.

My chalk is down at the bottom of the right-hand column, below the GeoURL link.

Next step: put up a drupal install somewhere so that Bowen Island folks can blog.
