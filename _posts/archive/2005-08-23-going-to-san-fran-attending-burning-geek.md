<p><a href="http://www.an9.org">termie</a> and <a href="http://www.factoryjoe.com">factoryjoe</a> are doing another one. On the night I think I had the couch booked (it's Kate's 30th birthday, so we're in San Fran until the 28th, then I have meetings which keep my in town until Sept. 4th -- <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/contact">call me</a>!)</p>

<blockquote>
You can start planning for the next event:

<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/28948">Burning Geek BBQ</a> happening at The Langpad (where Chris and I live) this Sunday (the 28th), 3pm+.

You bring the food, the booze and the skillz, we provide the venue. Emergent party, baby.
