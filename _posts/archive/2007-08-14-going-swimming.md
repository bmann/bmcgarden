<p>I've been trying to go swimming as much as possible this summer. In the ocean, because that's what I'm used to from growing up on an island.</p>

<p>Usually this is Jericho / Locarno Beaches here in Vancouver, or farther along at Spanish Banks. These are also great places to take along a little Hibachi and have a cook out or throw a frisbee around.</p>

<p>I'm going tonight (Tuesday) and will likely go most days while it's still sunny and warm. <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/contact">Give me a call</a> if you want to come: I usually aim to go around 6:30pm or so.</p>

<p>In sending out an email about this to some friends, <a href="http://www.iworkindustries.com">James</a> responded with a mention of the <a href="http://www.vowsa.bc.ca/">Vancouver Open Water Swimmers Association</a>. Huh. An association for swimming in the ocean. Again, just seems strange 'cause I grew up swimming by myself in the ocean all the time. In any case, looks like an interesting group, especially if you want to push yourself a little more and go for longer swims.</p>
