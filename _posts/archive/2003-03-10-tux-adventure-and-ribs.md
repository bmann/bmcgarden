That's Troy at Tip Top (they are an outlet for <a href="http://www.sydsilver.com/">Syd Silver Formalwear</a>). He's getting married this October, in Fredericton, and I'm the best man. This whole experience is quite new to me. It actually took a while to get everyone measured and all the paperwork filled out. Now all I have to do is pick up the tuxes in Fredericton.

For dinner, we went to Rob, Anna, and Adam's house and had ribs that had been slow-cooking all day, courtesy of Adam and Rob. Delicious! Then, of course, the bingo interlude, and back to their house to watch <a href="http://www.rulesofattraction.com/">Rules of Attraction</a>, an incredibly messed-up film that is interestingly shot, with lots of strange camera angles.
