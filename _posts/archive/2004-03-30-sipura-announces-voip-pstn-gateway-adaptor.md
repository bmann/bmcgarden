The inclusion of an FXO port on an external telephone adaptor is good news for users of the Asterisk open source PBX system who now must rely on internal computer interface cards to integrate PSTN service with the system.

<p>Now what I want to see is a <a href="http://www.knoppix.org">Knoppix</a>-based build of <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>. These types of announcements lead me to believe that it won't be long before we see appliance-type IP-PBXs, much like we have VPN appliances today: plug one in at any location, optionally configure it to point at similar appliances at remote locations, and voila! instant private, IP-based phone network. CPE <em>is</em> important -- Cisco realized this when they bought LinkSys.</p>
