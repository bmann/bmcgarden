The Knowledge Management Community of Practice (KMC) began in March 2001 as a "grass roots" organization that came together to learn about knowledge management (KM). KMC transitioned to a registered society that provides a forum in which we can participate in learning and developing KM business and learning solutions. It officially became a registered not-for-profit society on November 22, 2002, an achievement that we heartily celebrated at KMC's 2003 Spring Event.
