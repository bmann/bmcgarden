<p>The <a href="http://vonage.com/corporate/press_index.php">press release isn't up yet</a>, but it looks like <a href="http://www.vonage.ca" title="Vonage offers Canadian VoIP">Vonage is now in Canada</a>! They don't have a comprehensive listing of area codes, but it looks like every province except for Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland have at least one area code.</p>

<p>Read on for pricing levels (higher base price than <a href="http://www.primustel.ca/en/residential/talkbroadband/">Primus</a>), and features. It has a ton of features, but the price seems high. Of course, after I add voicemail, a second number, and pay for long distance to Primus, Vonage is cheaper with much better features (especially since I don't call outside North America).</p>
<!--break-->
<p>There are three pricing levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic 500:</strong> $19.99, includes 500 minutes anywhere in the US and Canada.</li>
<li><strong>Province Unlimited:</strong></strong>$34.99 for unlimited calls inside the province.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited</strong>: $45.99 for unlimited calls anywhere in the US and Canada.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much all the <a href="http://www.vonage.ca/features.php">features</a> are included in the basic price, except for "virtual phone numbers" (Vonage's name for additional area codes). They are $7.99 per month, and you can choose from Canadian or US area codes.</p>

<p>Two quick features -- Simul-Ring will ring two numbers at the same time (like your Vonage number and your cell phone) and you can pick up either one.</p>

<p>Voicemail has full phone, online, and by email support, including receiving your voicemail as an email attachment. Yes!</p>

<p>I'd love to hear people's experience in the <a href="/discussions">forums</a>.</p>
