<p>In wrapping up his feelings about GnomeDex, Lee LeFever pinged me to explain what our made up term 'The Dark Web' means. I don't feel entirely comfortably explaining it, so tag, you're it <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com">Richard</a>.</p>
 
<blockquote>
I&rsquo;ve been hearing more references to different things referred to as &lsquo;dark-something&rsquo;  Dark Blogs are Intranet blogs, <a href="http://www.darknet.com/">Dark Net</a> is a book by J.D. Lasica and 'The Dark Web' is something <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris Mann</a> will have to explain

<p>I actually do have my own Dark Web blog -- it's <a href="http://personal.bmannconsulting.com">my personal site</a>. In some ways, I would almost welcome a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal-like</a> (or Flickr-like) set of access rules so that only the people I want can read it. So, it means I sensor myself, but am OK with anyone looking there. After listening to <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie Leung's</a> presentation for the second time, I feel I'd like a private channel for some people in my life...including me, in the old personal journal/diary sense of the word.</p>
