That's right. The general outcry against comment mischief with the Drupal engine and this website has been <em>solved</em>! No thanks to me, in general.

<a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/module.php?mod=user&op=view&id=5">Evan</a> was the first to raise the alarm, rallying the troops to storm the firewalls and load balancers that protected this last outpost of journalistic fascism.

He brought in rhymes, dead South American freedom fights, and even tossed a dwarf or two.

Luckily, after a thorough search of the options available in the bowels of the administrative interface, and a short lull in work projects, the proper knobs were found and promptly tweaked.

Fear no more. Comment away. Dance, sing, and be merry!

(and perhaps get some sleep...)
