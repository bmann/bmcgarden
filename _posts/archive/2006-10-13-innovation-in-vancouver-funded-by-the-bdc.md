<p>Wasn&#39;t that a fun title? Not quite correct, of course -- but Jenny Yang who works at the <a href="http://www.bdc.ca">Business Development Bank of Canada aka BDC</a> did end up paying for beer at the Yaletown Brewery this afternoon. Thanks, Jenny! Other attendees were <a href="http://www.davidrdgratton.com/">David Gratton</a>, <a href="http://www.quixit.com">Michael Cole</a>, and <a href="http://khannafedina.com/">Sanja Khanna</a>. </p><p>Now that I&#39;ve got your attention, what am I talking about? Well, after Bryan and Stephanie Rieger of <a href="http://www.yiibu.com">Yiibu</a> left Vancouver (again!) to head back to Thailand, a bunch of people felt that the grassroots nature of Mobile Monday in Vancouver aka <a href="http://www.momovan.org">MoMoVan</a> kind of went away. An email discussion about potentially organizing some more grass roots events in Vancouver led to this first meeting tonight.</p><p>I actually was filling in for Roland (off in Rotterdam), who&#39;s the real mobile evangelist around. As it turns out, the discussion turned to a much broader theme than just mobile. Maybe something like a <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCamp">DemoCamp</a> -- regular presentations in Vancouver that bring together business, technical, academia, and content folks. Maybe this<br /></p><p><a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto1">DemoCamp Toronto</a> is a great example, although I do think it is quite tech centric (I could be wrong). We&#39;ve recently had <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver">BarCamp Vancouver</a> (tech/entrepreneur/++), <a href="http://casecamp.org/home/show/CaseCampVancouver1">Case Camp</a> (marketing) and <a href="http://barcamp.org/ArtCamp">Art Camp</a> (content / media). What with great music and movie talent here in the city, plus excellent tech roots, this kind of cross disciplinary event might be just thing.</p><p>So...what&#39;s the stumbling block? When do we do the first event? Who do we invite? Well, much like the <a href="http://www.innovationcommons.ca">Innovation Commons</a>, there is only so much time in the day when you&#39;re also running a business. And...what&#39;s the purpose of this thing? Is it &quot;just another DemoCamp&quot;? How do we attract cross disciplinary folks?<br /> </p><p>As a next step, the attendees decided on homework -- writing up a paragraph stating:</p><ul><li>what you would want out of such an event or what would be your interest, and how you would describe what this event should be or do? </li><li>drivers and blockers: what drivers are there for doing such an event in Vancouver? are there any blockers?</li><li>what is your definition of success of such an event? (e.g. number of attendees, more companies started in Vancouver, etc.)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Rather than just for the attendees at this meeting, I&#39;m giving this homework to everyone. Put your answer on the <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver">DemoCampVancouver</a> page or on your blog and add a link on that page.</p><p>Even better...someone interested in organizing this? Go for it!&nbsp;</p>
