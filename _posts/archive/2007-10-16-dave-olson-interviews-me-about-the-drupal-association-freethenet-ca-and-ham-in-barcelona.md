<p>It's been great to be sharing an office with the folks at <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com">Raincity Studios</a> -- they're now in the other side of our office, since <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com">NowPublic</a> moved out so they could grow their team.</p>

<p>Raincity has been adding new people, including long time social media generator <a href="http://uncleweed.net">Dave Olson</a>. Dave sat down with me in the office and <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/thestandard/boris-mann-speaks-about-drupal-wi-fi-and-ham">captured a podcast</a> about the <a href="http://association.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a>, <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org">Drupalcon Barcelona</a>, and the <a href="http://www.freethenet.ca">Free The Net.ca</a> project.</p>

<p>Dave's a master of podcasts, and Raincity Studios is now part of <a href="http://drupal.org/planet">Planet Drupal</a>, so expect lots more quality Drupal-related content from there.</p>
