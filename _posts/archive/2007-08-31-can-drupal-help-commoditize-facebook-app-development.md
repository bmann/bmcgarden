<p>The answer is "probably yes". I just wrote up a <a href="http://bryght.com/blog/boris-mann/facebook-apps-with-drupal">description of our Vancouver Drupal Users Group event over on Bryght</a>, but saved the provocative title for here.</p>

<p>I think that maybe I'll lift my stance on only adding Facebook apps that have a "public Internet" face as well. Much as I hate locking data into Facebook, I do want to support local developers: <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2007/08/activestates-up.html">ActiveState's Up4</a>, <A href="http://blog.dabbledb.com/2007/08/introducing-dab.html">DabbleDB's DabbleDo</a>, and the soon-to-be-released Opus Player by the <a href="http://www.donatgroup.com/">Donat Group<a/> / <a href="http://www.projectopus.com">Project Opus</a>.</p>

<p>But don't think I won't be continuing to push folks to figure out ways to nicely push and pull data in and out of Facebook in a way that benefits the open Internet as well as respects the privacy and security of user's content within Facebook.</p>

<p>Finally I wanted to share with you that yes, we did indeed continue to chat over beer. The strangest phrase that came up was <a href="http://raincoaster.com/2007/08/31/camel-cheese/">camel cheese</a>. Nice.</p>
