<p>I tend to agree with Rands:</p>

<blockquote>
My question remains. What is the purpose of a tag cloud? It's more interesting than a bulleted list, but as user interface goes it's a aflutter with clutter. If you tell me this is intended to a casual interface for browsing tags, I'll buy it, but if it's intended to more useful than a stumblable interface, I'd like to hear your theories...

<p>Favourite two phrases: &quot;aflutter with clutter&quot; and &quot;stumblable interface&quot;.</p>

<p>What do I want? I want &quot;top tags today&quot;, &quot;my top tags&quot;, &quot;popular tags of all time&quot;, and ways of applying these tags as I add AND browse content. The whole issue of a personal tag space vs. a global tag space is something that needs exploring on an application by application basis, too. Which opens the door to permissions models and identity, of course...</p>

<p>Are tags really just an aid to search? I think we can begin to do more interesting things when we can make links between different people's thoughts on tags. My &quot;restaurant&quot; means the same thing as your &quot;restaurant&quot;. My &quot;Vancouver&quot; is Vancouver, BC, not Vancouver, WA.</p>

<p>Groups of people could attach themselves to certain tags and &quot;agree&quot; that it means the same thing to them.</p>

<p>Yeah, this ended up being a brain dump on tag ideas, a lot of which are just half-baked concepts right now. But...will we point at Rands' post and say &quot;this is when the love affair with tags began to decline?&quot; :P</p>
