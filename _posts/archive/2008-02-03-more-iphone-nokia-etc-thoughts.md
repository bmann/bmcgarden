<p>Chris Bovard just left a <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/iphone-nano#comment-136760">great comment on the iPhone Nano thread</a> -- here's the closer on his post about why he's unlikely to get an iPhone and why he can't understand why everyone is so hyped about it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My next phone purchase will be N95 8gig because I love my current N95. If I buy another bigger phone it will be a http://www8.garmin.com/nuvifone/ when it is out. I own an older Garmin GPS I use for mountaineering. You can drop it and it goes under water. If Garmin puts this much though into their phone well the iphone will be just another toy.</p>

<p>Maybe time for everyone too look at the big picture instead of yet another Mac babysitter product for the mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Mac babysitter product" is a great post. Except, well, the masses WANT babysitter products. I <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/iphone-nano#comment-136761">replied in the same thread</a> -- here's the last bit of my comment:</p>

<blockquote>
Food for thought. I am all for competition, so I hope that Nokia continues with Series 60 development and also innovates in their new Linux-based systems (ref: their purchase of Trolltech, which makes cross platform GUI stuff). What these other players MUST realize is that the time has come where the mobile phone is moving BEYOND the bounds of the walled garden telcos, into the open platform of the Internet, and all competitors MUST strive to engage with network and platform effects in order to succeed long term.

<p>The mobile market is one of those areas where so much interesting stuff is happening. I'm glad that we're having these types of discussions.</p>
