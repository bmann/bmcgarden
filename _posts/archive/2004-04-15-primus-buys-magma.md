<p>With Primus' push into VoIP, they need more really solid data networks and data centers. Since <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/03/18/business/manitobatelecom_040318">Manitoba Telecom is buying AllStream</a> (Primus's current network provider and <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/nove/view/834#comment-1480">CLEC</a>), it may be that Primus is looking to own more of its infrastructure. Less reliance on a telco that may launch competitive services is probably a good thing.</p>
