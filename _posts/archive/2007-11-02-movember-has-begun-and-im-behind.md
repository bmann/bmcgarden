<p>We're in the month of <a href="http://www.movember.com">Movember</a>. What? Yep, Mo-vember:</p>

<blockquote>
“During Movember (the month formerly known as November) I’ll be growing a Mo (slang for Moustache). That’s right I’m bringing the Mo back because I’m passionate about men’s health and the fight against prostate cancer.
</blockquote>

<p>And there is even a dedicated <a href="http://blog.prostatecancer.ca/'>Canadian Movember blog</a>. I signed up on the main site where you can <a href="https://www.movember.com/us/donate/donate-details.php?action=showrego&rego=145294">donate directly</a> -- all donations are made directly to the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation of Canada. This strikes pretty close to home: my dad has been having trouble with his prostate, so this means a lot to me.</p>

<p>And, er, yeah: here's the thing...I haven't gone "mo free" yet. I still have a beardy face. So I'm behind in the race to grow the best mo. I'll get that taken care of this weekend...it needs special implements.</p>

<p>I'm especially impressed with <a href="http://www.stephanievacher.com/blog/?p=43">Stephanie</a>, who is being a "mo ho" (as opposed to "mo bro" for the men) -- she is going to fashion some sort of yarn moustache throughout the month. Andy Smith is inaugurating his first month at Google by <a href="http://term.ie/blog/movember/">going mo</a>. <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com">Kris</a> is off in China, so he hasn't been around to whip up support this year.</p>
