<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.mathemagenic.com">Lilia Efimova</a> and I, on the night before <a href="http://blogwalk.mediapedagogy.com">BlogWalk</a>, were talking about how we tend to start talking about the technology involved when people ask us about blogging. We throw in RSS, trackback and whatnot. Probably because the tools are what all blogs have in common.</p>

<p>But that is not why we find blogging so useful. That is about how it changed and shaped us, our learning, our professional development etc. So we thought about gathering blog stories to illustrate how blogs made a difference to you (and me).</p>

<p>I've opened a wiki-space, called <a href="http://www.zylstra.org/extra/wakka.php?wakka=BlogStories">BlogStories</a>, where you can add your story / stories.</p><cite><a href="http://blog.zylstra.org/archives/001234.html">Ton's Interdependent Thoughts: BlogStories</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>What more is there to say? Let's try and find non-techie words that explain personal publishing.</p>
