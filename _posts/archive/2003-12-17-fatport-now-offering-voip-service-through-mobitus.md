<p><a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/002693.html">According to Wi-Fi Networking News</a>, FatPort is offering VoIP service through a division called <a href="http://www.mobitus.com/">mobitus</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Users must get the mobitus software phone for their laptops and a headset. The service costs $16.95 (CDN) a month which includes unlimited calls to other mobitus customers. Long distance rates apply to long-distance calls to non-mobitus users.
</blockquote>

<p>This is very cool, because it shows that FatPort understands one of the hurdles of their service: what do you do with a wireless Internet connection? They are attacking this by developing the services themselves.</p>

<p>The service includes voicemail, call display, call waiting, and 3-way calling. You get email when you have voicemail. You can even get a toll-free number so that anyone in North America can call you for free. Currently, no support for a "real" phone number, but this is planned to be offered for US, Canadian, and UK phone numbers for an additional charge.</p>

<p>The system requirements list Windows-only options, but the <a href="http://www.mobitus.com/support/faq/">FAQ</a> lists all the details you need to set up any software or hardware SIP clients. Which means Mac users could use the softphone from <a href="http://www.xten.com/">Xten</a>. Hmmm...seeing as how I haven't really gotten around to using the <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/view/373">Free World Dialup</a> number I have, I don't know if I would use this, yet. The choice of broadband connections is still in my future here in Vancouver, so something else that can perhaps help me avoid getting a landline.</p>
