Evan had been asking the other day about tools or setups for OS X to send mail while wandering around various networks. Mac OS X has sendmail built in, of course, but there are some niceties about configuring it, especially on a laptop where you are connecting to different networks.

<a href="http://au.gu.st/">au</a> seems to do a number of interesting things that might fit the bill:
<blockquote>au is a packaging of SMALL BEAUTIFUL tools that allow you to be more autonomous on a network.  This version includes a number of Daniel J. Bernstein's utilities including djbdns, qmail, and daemontools.  The effect of this combination provides you with a DNS cache and Rendezvous-based email.</blockquote>
