<p>I've got the Mac version, now available from the <a href="http://support.opml.org/download">download page at support.opml.org</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out I hate the way that <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/boris/">opml blogs work</a> -- the anchor-based perma-links, the no separate entries, the weirdo "adding a link to a whole entry". I think the OPML editor should stick to what it does best -- working with OPML outlines. Actually, talking to <a href="http://www.mixedcontent.com">Colin</a> and others, we really just want to have <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">Omni Outliner</a> speak instant outlining.</p>

<p>But this begs the question, what are we building here? I think this could be done with Jabber, the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0024.html">Publish/Subscribe JEP</a>, and passing back and forth OPML document fragments. With identity and presence built in, of course. Would <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> be open to swapping out the communications protocol with something more standards based?</p>

<p>It's the same reason I'd like to see <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit's protocol opened</a> -- there are many more things we could build if these were standards.</p>

<p>In any case, thanks Dave for giving us a new old thing to experiment with.Try subscribing to my Instant Outline. Not sure if this works yet.</p>
