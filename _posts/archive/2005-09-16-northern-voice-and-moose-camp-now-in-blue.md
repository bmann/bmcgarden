<p><a href="http://2005.northernvoice.ca">This year</a> we did Northern Voice in Vancouver. We had a fantastic time and met a ton of interesting people.</p>  <p>The moose is loose again, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2005/09/the-moose-got-loose-again.html">as Darren says</a>, as we start planning for the February 2006 edition of of Northern Voice...now with bonus Moose Camp the day before.</p>  <p>Wander over to <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca">the site</a> and glory in the all the techie tweaks the other organizers let me roll in this year. I've been so busy that I've managed to only contribute a little to the process so far. But...potluck! I will get this off the ground this time.</p>  <p>What are you waiting for? Clicky-clicky!</p>  <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca"><img src="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/sites/2006.northernvoice.ca/files/theme_editor/northernvoice/2006banner.gif" /></a></p>
