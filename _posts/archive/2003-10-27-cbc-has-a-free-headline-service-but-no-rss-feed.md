<p>Of course they have a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/freeheadlines/index.html">headline service</a>. Of course they <a href="http://www.reinvented.net/article/1600">don't have RSS feeds</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Following your request, it is impossible to send you any RSS feed due to our strict policy. We understand your point, but we do not send it to particulars. We hope this will answer your questions.
</blockquote>

<p>I went ahead and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/freeheadlines/contact.html">emailed the service</a> and asked for an RSS feed. If enough people email, they might start to implement.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> CBC now has a <a href="/node/1401" title="CBC RSS feeds">basic headline-only RSS feed</a>.</p>
