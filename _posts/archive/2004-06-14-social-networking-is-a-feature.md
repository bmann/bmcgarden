<p>Quoting a quote as seen on <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/4351347570381003/">Social Networking Glut = Greater Than Four</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
RIESCHEL: We looked at five sites and passed on everything. In '99 everyone got in trouble when maybe 17 companies  were all trying to sell pet food online. <em>At Mobius, now if we identify more than four venture-backed start-ups in a sector, we won't bite.</em> <strong><em>There are at least 14 social-networking sites.</em></strong>
</blockquote

<p>This one is easy: exactly what I've been saying for quite some time -- social networking is a <em>feature</em> not a business model.</p>
