This is a new application with all the buzzwords -- p2p file sharing, instant messaging, search agents, web serving.

The site says that a "preview release" will be available, free of charge, initially for Win32, with Mac OS X version "scheduled for 2003".

Sounds like a bunch of interesting components, almost like what <a href="http://www.groove.net/">Groove</a> was hoping to be.
