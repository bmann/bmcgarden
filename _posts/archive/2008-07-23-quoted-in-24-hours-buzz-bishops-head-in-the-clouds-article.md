<p><a href="http://buzzbishop.com">Buzz Bishop</a> put a <a href="http://twitter.com/buzzbishop/statuses/861453135">request for cloud computing experts</a>. I'm not exactly an expert, but it is something that I've been looking into more deeply lately (see my <a href="http://del.icio.us/borismann/cloudcomputing">cloud links on del.icio.us</a>). And, of course, I'm advising <a href="http://trevoro.ca">TrevorO's</a> startup, <a href="http://layerboom.com">Layerboom</a>, through <a href="http://bootuplabs.com">Bootup Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I ended up writing a fairly lengthy set of answers to questions that Buzz sent across, some of which made their way into his article in today's 24 Hours -- <a href="http://www.cyberbuzz.com/2008/07/23/head-in-the-clouds/">Head in the Clouds</a>. Thanks for the opportunity, Buzz!</p>
