<p>aka the "I am so far behind that I even had to <a href="http://megancole.org/2007/12/06/the-three-week-summary-of-missed-blog-posts/">steal the title of this post from Megan</a>"</p>

<p>I was joking with Meg that I was just going to cut and paste her entire blog post. It's not that far off :P We're heading into Christmas break time, but still lots and lots of stuff on the go, and good things right in the New Year.</p>

<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver04">DemoCampVancouver04</a> had a great turnout...with surprisingly few presentations ready to go on deck! As it turned out, once we canvassed the crowd, we did end up with a great crew of people standing up. Special thanks to <a href="http://momentumplanet.com/">Amy Walker from Momentum magazine</a> -- I put her on the spot asking her to present and she did a super fantastic job.</p>

<p>Battledecks were fun, and I think the mixer afterwards at <a href="http://www.fluxbistro.com">Flux Bistro</a> was a good way to continue the evening. TechVibes did a <a href="http://techvibesblog.com/adhack-presents-at-democampvancouver04/">good job of covering DC04</a> -- but they don't have a "tag" or other way to show all of the posts, you'll just have to click around. Next one? January, I guess...we'll have to start planning that!</p>

<p>The second installment of <a href="http://www.launchpartyhq.com">Launch Party</a> was great. Go, Maura, go! I think we can still tweak the timing and the space, but there were a ton of people and I think a lot of connections got made.</p>

<p>I probably spent too much time picking apart the <a href="http://www.sitemasher.com">Sitemasher</a> team -- I'm looking forward to talking more with them. The <a href="http://twiistup.com/">Twiistup</a> folks attended, and I'm debating going down to the <a href="http://twiistup3-widget.eventbrite.com/">Jan 16th event</a>. Got to meet <a href="http://shiralazar.com/">Shira Lazar</a> -- bugged her to submit as a speaker for <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca">Northern Voice</a> -- you should, too! (deadline is end of day....today!)</p>

<p><a href="http://openid.net/2007/12/05/openid-2_0-final-ly/">OpenID 2.0 and Attribute Exchange 1.0 being finalized</a> are a big deal. Now we can go back and re-implement a bunch of stuff we had working 3 years ago, just on top of standards and extensible this time. And yes, <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/12/09/my-openid-shitlist-hitlist-and-wishlist-for-2008/">Messina</a>, Drupal.org and related properties providing AND accepting OpenID are on the "to do" list.</p>

<p>Closely related to this is <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/2007/12/06/fsn_workshop">RalphM's workshop on Federating social networks</a>. He's at <a href="http://www.mediamatic.nl/">Mediamatic</a> now (man, do I have fond memories of <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarcampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a> there!) and continue to think about how XMPP, identity, and websites intersect. There are <a href="http://bitlets.nl/20071208/fererating_social_networks/audio/">audio recordings</a> and other material that I need to set aside time to absorb and comment on.</p>

<p>Summary thoughts: across-the-cloud integration using both poll (feeds) and push (XMPP) are definitely possible, we need to do some prototype implementations and do some interop testing.</p>

<p>I should probably say "thanks!" to all the folks that left nice comments on my brief <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/bryght-and-raincity-are-joining-forces">Bryght is joining Raincity</a> post. Yes, it's still a bit weird to be sending with an @raincitystudios.com email address. Yes, I'm stoked about the new situation and am really enjoying working with the bigger team.</p>
