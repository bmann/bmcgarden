<p>I missed my chance to be on the CBC show BC Almanac today. I was busy working and didn't check my Gmail account until later in the day (Darren mentioned that I should put my cellphone number on my website...and he was right). A producer from the BC Almanac show called, wanting to get my take on residential VoIP, what with Shaw's announcement of their ridiculously over-priced service ($55CDN!).</p>

<p>I would have talked about something similar to the following:</p>

<p>There are quite a few residential VoIP solutions in Canada now. Shaw's is among the most expensive, and there is really no point to picking them over "traditional" phones. <a href="http://primustel.ca/">Primus</a> is slashing their prices, but they are using old technology and suffer from quality issues. <a href="http://www.vonage.ca">Vonage</a> is high-quality and is what I would recommend for the "average" user.</p>

<p>There are a number of lower-priced, national competitors starting up such as <a href="http://www.netfone.ca">Netfone.ca</a>, <a href="http://worldcity.yak.com/">Yak</a>, <a href="http://ca.inter.net">ca.inter.net</a>. In reality, anyone can become a "VoIP provider" -- there are a number of wholesale and turn-key solutions. The other big thing is "softphones" -- meaning wherever I have my laptop and an Internet connection, I can make and receive calls. This includes proprietary solutions like <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> as well as VoIP providers that offer a softphone connected to a "real" phone number.</p>

<p>The real story here is that the cost of voice communications is trending towards zero. Features are the only thing that customers are willing to pay for (that is, with a race towards zero or flat-rate cost for unlimited long distance anywhere).</p>

<p>Sigh. Next time, I guess. Maybe I can talk about how CBC is <a href="http://holycola.net/archives/000634.html#comments">using Wikipedia.org as source material</a>.</p>
