<p>I&#39;m sitting at the opening remarks of <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com">Gnomedex</a> in Seattle.</p><p>Just wrapped two fantastic days at <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcamp-seattle-2006">DrupalCamp Seattle</a>. As always, I thoroughly enjoyed my time hanging with Drupaleers from all over. I was amazed at how far people traveled: we had participants from Calgary, Minnesota, San Francisco, and probably more places that I&#39;m not aware of. This Drupal thing might just take off!</p><p>Actually, I think that&#39;s the amazing thing: people are picking up Drupal for all sorts of projects. As much hype as Ruby on Rails gets, it is so enjoyable to meet people that are learning the Drupal interface and doing very cool things without being programmers or developers.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And of course, Chris Pirillo just let us know that <a href="http://feeds.pirillo.com/ChrisPirillo?m=1007">TechMeme was hacked</a>.</p>
