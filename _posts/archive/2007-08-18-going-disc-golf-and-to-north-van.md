<p>Looks like I'm going to lead a Sunday expedition tomorrow to go <A href="http://gambit.instruct.langara.bc.ca/~cstd2411/qhomepage/qhomepage/html/course.html">disc golfing at Queen E aka Little Mountain Disc Golf Park</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of disc golf newbees....turns out I've been playing for something like 12 years, ever since I started going to UVic. I haven't managed to make it out many times here, best thing to do is recruit new folks who want to come out and play. I have some other disc golf dates to schedule, too. Talking shop on the disc golf course -- what could be better?!</p>

<p>In any case, if you didn't get an email invite, ping me if you want to come tomorrow morning (10am~ish? we're gathering details...). Afterwards, a by-transit field trip over to see <a href="http://www.uncleweed.net">DaveO's</a> new place in North Vancouver. Transit! North Vancouver! Shock! Horror!</p>
