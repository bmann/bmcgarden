[Robin Dechant wrote about the Germany startup / innovation ecosystem](https://medium.com/@robindchnt/germany-we-have-a-structural-problem-and-we-need-to-solve-it-together-c0dbafff24bb).

Lots of great reading about the specifics of the problem, from distributed cities, universities, and big company headquarters:

This, of course, sounds incredibly familiar to someone in Canada.

I could probably write the same article about the Canadian market and the tension between Vancouver/Toronto/Montreal (never mind smaller cities and regions).

Totally agree that each country / region has to figure out how to succeed uniquely -- while ALSO cross pollinating with the global startup / venture community that has lots in common.

_Especially_ when we see a rising trend in fully distributed teams. I feel like Berlin is probably Top 3 in the world in "digital nomads" that more could be done with.
