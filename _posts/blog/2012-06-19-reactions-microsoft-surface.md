I used Storify to collect a number of the reactions that have been ricocheting around the web in response to Microsoft's announcement of the all new [Surface tablet](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/). I am puzzled by their pre-announcement, happy to see more competition in this space, and really hope they succeed in shipping.

_It's been fascinating to see the story of the "all new" Microsoft Surface evolve since yesterday afternoon. I posted a short link blog this morning._

> Boris Mann's Link Blog Awesome. This is MSFT stepping up to the plate. There are many (many, many, many) questionable / weird things about the launch, the marke...

>Kevin Tofel / GigaOm:
>"Spec sheets, press releases, videos and a product demo do not a successful product make. The experience of using Windows 8 on the Surface devices is far more important. And _that’s_&nbsp;the big unknown right now. What is known, however, is that Monday will likely be considered a huge turning point in the history of Microsoft. For three decades, it was content to deliver software for a price to any hardware maker willing to pay. Now it seems that **no price is enough for Microsoft to fully trust its future to computer makers**."

_(emphasis mine)_

> Microsoft Surface: A new tablet and a bold strategy Microsoft did Monday what many would consider unthinkable: It introduced Surface, a new 10.6-inch tablet with two different models design...

> Mark Hachman / RWW:
>"Apple’s iPad evokes a feeling of luxury, while top-of-the-line Android tablets like the Galaxy Tab feel fast and efficient, but not overly polished. The Surface feels like a Cadillac: powerful, luxurious… solid. There’s nothing flimsy about it."

>Hands On with Microsoft's New Surface Tablet: A few minutes spent actually handling a prototype of Microsoft's new Surface tablet reveals a solid device, combining a slightly bulky ch...

> Steve Ballmer, quoted in the AllThingsD article:
> “If you look at the bulk of the 375 million machines that get sold (next year), they probably aren’t going to be Surfaces,” Ballmer told&nbsp;AllThingsD. “On the other hand, we could have a sizeable business.”

> Scratching the Surface With Windows Chief Steven Sinofsky: Windows chief Steven Sinofsky said Monday that Microsoft certainly had a tablet like the Surface in mind when it started doing Windows 8....

> Evidence MS is only half-serious about Surface. Steve saying &quot;prime the pump&quot; and MS Store/online only. This is about leading, not winning. Charlie Kindel

_I think everyone is excited that Microsoft is stepping up to the plate. Long time mobile expert Brian Fling:_

> I wouldn’t call the Microsoft Surface a slam dunk but it is a solid tablet entry from Redmond Brian Fling

_Ethan is not so optimistic. I agree with this stance - until you ship, and you ship with some sort of ecosystem, the prettiness of the hardware won't mean much. Although, I think the lack of combined hardware / software **excellence** is what forced Microsoft to do this device themselves._

> Reminder: no apps, no price, no date, no app ecosystem. Let's not get ahead of ourselves in the rush to get ahead of others. Ethan Kaplan

> A world changing device! Release date, specs, price are tbd. So is the “world changing” Ethan Kaplan

> Best part of http://surface.com - &quot;Images are design renderings and not photographs.&quot; No wonder it's called Vapor Mg.Ken Schafer

> so why was MS in such a hurry to show that? could've shown it closer to WinRT launch. announcing way ahead of availability is ALWAYS bad. Chris Ziegler

_Brad puts it even more succinctly - it's not the hardware:_

> It's not about the device. #MicrosoftSurfaceTablet http://post.ly/7qcs3 Brad Ovenell-Carter

_Some think you can't succeed in the tablet market unless you own the OS._

> There's now a velvet rope around the tablet market. If you own an OS, you're in. If you don't, enjoy the view. Lessien

> The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/global/surface/en/us/renderingassets/surfacespecsheet.pdf">spec sheet</a> makes it clear that while there are two "versions", they really are very different. The WinRT / ARM version is the consumer version. The Windows 8 / Intel version is the pro, enterprise version. Must Microsoft's licensing strategy infect everything?

> It just dawned on me that Windows RT could be a huge failure due to consumer confusion, and cause massive collateral damage across PCs... Russell Beattie

_Brian has interesting thoughts on how the mobile web fits into such a new launch. Windows 8, with it's focus on web technologies, is going to be very interesting._

> A new form factor AND two processor architectures. Thank web we have media queries. xnoɹǝʃ uɐıɹq

> Also note: Windows 8 runs NodeJS. Google IO should prove interesting. Facebook is in over their heads. They need a browser and a phone. xnoɹǝʃ uɐıɹq</div>

> @brianleroux Win8/x64 runs Node but haven't built it yet for Win8/ARM (since MSFT hasn't release an arm iso) theoretically it should work... Ryan Dahl</div>

_I feel for Nokia. But perhaps that chapter is simply closed._

_The PC industry that currently exists by selling Windows computers? They're in an interesting spot, to say the least._

> So, er, I'm not bullish on the tablet strategy of, oh, HP, Dell, Lenovo and Acer, and apparently neither is Microsoft. Ashlee Vance

> Microsoft now making hardware that will directly compete with its PC licensees. Should be interesting. Jason Snell

> Don't focus too much on Microsoft competing with other PC vendors. They all have the same main competitor in Apple. Ross Rubin

> This is a total flip of MSFTs business model of software licensing. Michael Gartenberg

_Wondering where the "old" Microsoft Surface went? The technology is called Microsoft PixelSense, and the new hardware is made by Samsung, and called the SUR40._
