Both Mac Mini and OWC Memory Upgrade kit arrived today. Don't have a monitor yet, going to temporarily use the 15" portable screen that R uses for her second monitor.

Following the [OWC Memory Upgrade video](https://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/mac-mini-2018-memory/Macmini8-1/), step two is having a torx screwdriver. Hmmm. Sounds like a T4, T5, and T10 needed. 

OK, looks like Canadian Tire has a complete overkill [66 piece Mastercraft Specialty Precision Electronics Bit](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/mastercraft-specialty-precision-electronics-bit-set-66-pc-0573624p.html#srp)

(adding notes almost a month later)

Right in here is where I put in my 2 bike rides to Canadian Tire in Burnaby in one afternoon / evening, and still don't have the right screwdrivers.
