I did end up ordering a [[Mac Mini]] as a new home desktop PC, so now I need to order RAM.

I had [previously]({% link _posts/journal/2020-09-26-journal.md %}) looked up OWC RAM, and I can order direct from them. Are there local places in Vancouver? Listed as resellers, [dmac don't list the 2018/2020 Mac Mini](https://www.dmac.ca/mac-mini-mac-pro) and [Simply doesn't seem to list the right RAM either](https://www.simply.ca/collections/ram).[[Why don't small businesses keep their websites up to date???::rmn]] OK, guess I order [direct from OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/mac-mini), Total cost was $258CAD including shipping and duties.

OWC have one [[eGPU]] enclosure, the [AKiTiO Node Titan](https://eshop.macsales.com/item/AKiTiO/NPTNT3/) (as well as bundles that include AMD graphics cards). I haven't done any research on eGPUs yet, other than noting that Apple had the [Blackmagic eGPU](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/blackmagicegpu/) available for sale from them directly.

External storage is a whole other thing. I looked up the [[Filecoin]] [guide to storage mining](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-guide-to-storage-mining/) and basically you need a $3KUSD AMD machine at a minimum to do mining. Just syncing the Filecoin blockchain (which I do want to experiment with), needs 12GB per week:
> If you don’t wish to mine, but would still like to run the Lotus client for the purposes of keeping a wallet or interfacing with the network, a system with 2-4 CPU cores, 8GiB of RAM, and enough storage for the Filecoin blockchain should be sufficient (the current testnet chain grows at about 12GiB per week; improvements to reduce this storage requirement are ongoing).

Like I said, researching the right combination of external enclosures and drives and such is for another time. I've never really stored a lot of media on drives / at home.

Biked over to Hinge Park and hung out with @cambel and @catthekin:

We sort of talked about [[Fifth Generation Management]], but only in between other topics.

Messed around with a [[Fission]] [timing log](https://talk.fission.codes/t/timing-log-of-publishing-with-fission/1077) of publishing this site.

[[Path of Exile]] now has a MacOS client! 26GB download, and hard to find the links required.
