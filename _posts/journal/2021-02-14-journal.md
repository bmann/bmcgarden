As I was finishing up my [[Drop in Audio]] blog post, [Jam](https://jam.systems), an open source Clubhouse [on GitLab `jam-systems/jam`](https://gitlab.com/jam-systems/jam), debuted [on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jam-d17ff3cc-556c-4c17-8140-5211cb1cd81f). I took a quick look at the code and it requires a few moving pieces and Docker, but it's a great little starting point.
