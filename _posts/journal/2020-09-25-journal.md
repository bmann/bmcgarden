## Self rendering Markdown

I compiled all the [Javascript Markdown scripts](https://talk.fission.codes/t/self-rendering-markdown-docs-library-research/1032) into a test deploy on [[Fission]] at https://petite-junior-angular-llama.fission.app.

## @-mentions as key network signifier

Had a good call with [[Rabble]] talking about [[UCAN]], [[Planetary]], and the "discovery" problem in social networks. Specifically, mapping unique identifiers like a hash or a key to a username. And, that those usernames probably all look like _@username_ (back to [[Social Mentions]]!).

Twitter was the undisputed champion of @-usernames, but I'd say that Instagram is as big or bigger depending on the context. Celebrity, food, small business are increasingly defaulting to IG as the primary @-username.

Yes, many other systems use @-usernames, but the "default" mapping is to Twitter.

Idea that I floated for portability / look-ups: usernames linked to [[DID]]s using [[Verifiable Claims]]. This "proves" that a DID has control over a username on a given network.
