## Flancian's Anagora

I've been having a [conversation with Flancian](https://social.coop/@flancian/105289034946739103) about their [[Anagora]] project: a meta / multi-user knowledge garden. They have implemented [[Roam Research]], [[Foam]], and [[Obsidian]] adapters so far.

Since I'm working on a [[Simply Jekyll Template]] repo that is less customized than my site here, I can use that to see about connecting into Anagora.
