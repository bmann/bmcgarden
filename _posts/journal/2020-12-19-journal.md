## Microblog Sidebar

Got the [[Micro.blog]] sidebar installed on the front page. Yeah, my _username_ is `boris`, even though Boris Jabes has the `boris.micro.blog` blog name :)

Hmm. Not really usable. It doesn't include permalinks to the entries. Going to embed it on the [[Micro.blog]] page as an example, along with requests for what I'd like to see.

## PostHog

Also installed [[PostHog]] which I'm going to use for [[Fission]] but just testing it in the header of this blog now :)

Forked the [FOSS repo](https://github.com/bmann/posthog-foss) (none of their proprietary enterprise code in it), so that I could edit the README so that the [[Deploy To Heroku]] could deploy the FOSS version.

## Bandcamp Request for Design Change

I've been using [[Bandcamp]] more. Whenever I'm using it on the web, I get tripped up on how small / hidden wishlisting an album / track is.

Look at this screenshot:

![Bandcamp Screenshot]({% link assets/2020/12/bandcamp-zia-screenshot.png %})

Rather than that little heart that says _Wishlist_ / _In Wishlist_, I always hit the big heart at the top of the page...which takes me to **my** favourites, and doesn't heart the page at all.

My brain has been conditioned by Instagram and other systems that I can double-click on the big image and/or somewhere top right of the page to "heart" a page.

So: hide that heart at the top that is actually "my favourites" and stick it under my avatar or otherwise more than 1 click away on an album page.

Make it so that I can "heart" by double clicking the album art! Clicking to get a big album view

...sure, give me a magnifying glass icon to embiggen it. Or, give me an "invite to heart" on that embiggened album image. Let me look at this album...oh yeah...favourite, wait, I need to cancel at top left, and then navigate alllll the way back to that tiny Wishlist under the album and click again. Wait what, there is ALSO a "view" link here once it is "In Wishlist"? And **that** pops open my wishlist in a new window?

Have another giant heart top left? next to album name? or somewhere else that gives me a nice big target.

Come on Bandcamp! Make hearts better!

BTW, this particular screenshot page is a recommendation from [@bgins](https://bandcamp.com/bgins), [Drum 'n' Space, by Elaine Walker / ZIA](https://ziaspace.bandcamp.com/album/drum-n-space).

## MIDI Keyboard

The same @bgins from above makes [Moon Forge](https://moon-forge.brianginsburg), an app with [[Fission]] webnative integrated, that connects to music keyboard synths with [[WebMIDI]].

He recommends the [Arturia KeyStep](https://www.arturia.com/store/hybrid-synths/keystep).

I found it on [local Vancouver music store Tom Lee Music](https://www.tomleemusic.ca/186019). Purchased!

Maybe I do music now?
