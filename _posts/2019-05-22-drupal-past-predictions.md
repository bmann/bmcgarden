Dries Buytaert sent an email to core contributors in August 2010 asking what we though Drupal would look like if it was 10x bigger:

Here was my answer:

How does Drupal play in a world where we will do data design first, and display == mobile touch across multiple screens? How do we stay relevant in that world?

The next frontier is not LAMP or any stack at all but Google App Engine and from the ground up web apps written on top of node.js and other server-side JavaScript. Quercus is a kludge. Where is the line from where Drupal is today to that non-LAMP future?

Say we power 10% of the web, and that's where the 10x. How do we federate automatically? How do we build the open web? How do we CREATE standards and get others to adopt them, rather than being the first to "build a module for that".

How can Drupal sites re-use data on a more massive scale? Have you seen http://scratchpads.eu/ (next round of funding is 20M EU)? That is the sound of Drupal powering a "knowledge sphere" that (again) has a straight line to the early days and John VanDyk's entomology site.

How do we promote our culture of sharing / give back by default in a world where every regional web shop takes Drupal off the shelf, adds a design, and could care less about core? aka the WordPress model

That was almost 9 years ago. I'm still thinking about these same topics, reflected in the last part of [FISSION's](https://fission.codes) mission: "exploring fundamental shifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans."
