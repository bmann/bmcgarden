An overview of my social accounts and posting. It can be summarized as mostly [[POSSE]].[^overload]

[^overload]: And overload! Yes I realize this is a lot of accounts and protocols and platforms to experiment with. The last time it was this dense was the mid 2000s. This time around, I‚Äôm hoping we can end up in more interoperable protocols, with my hope being that [ActivityPub and ATProtocol](https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/2024/01/05/why-not-both-protocols/) are both solid foundations for the next generation of not just social networks, but many apps.

This started as a short post to put directly into a single Mastodon post, but kind of got out of hand, so now it‚Äôs a blog post.

It‚Äôs also why it starts with my three Mastodon accounts. 

My <https://bmann.ca> landing page links to all my social accounts[^all], and [@bmann.ca is my Bluesky username](https://bsky.bmann.ca).

[^all]: Technically not all of them. I have Instagram and Facebook accounts that I don‚Äôt use. I have a Swarm/Foursquare account. I will add my [[Noosphere]] DID I guess! Maybe I will go in and at least list all my accounts üòÖ

* I use [@boris@cosocial.ca](https://cosocial.ca/@boris) as my main Mastodon account. It receives cross-posts from my [personal blog](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com). Food photos, local Vancouver adventures, travel.

* [@boris@fission.social](https://fission.social/@boris) is my work account - decentralized compute [@everywherecomputer@fission.social](https://fission.social/@everywherecomputer), [[IPFS]] and protocol discussions

* [@boris@toolsforthought.social](https://toolsforthought.social/@boris) is hooked up to my [journal feed](https://bmannconsulting.com](https://bmannconsulting.com/) (you‚Äôre reading a journal entry here). The journal items also get cross-posted to [@bmannconsulting.com on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bmannconsulting.com)

[Tech Blog](https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/) posts I‚Äôm not auto cross posting. In part because they come across as just title plus link without any context in [[Micro.blog]]‚Äôs feed cross posting. 

[[Fedica]] is a commercial service that does cross posting. The Fedica model supports 8 accounts even at the free account tier, which is great! But, even at paid tiers, you can only use one account per network, so right away it doesn‚Äôt support my three Mastodon accounts. And yeah, I have a pile of company and project accounts I run for work on the [Fission Mastodon Server l](https://fission.social/@fission).

There‚Äôs a whole other discussion to be had here about the affordances of each network[^affordances] that fights against cross-posting. No hashtags on Bluesky or Micro.blog. No quote posting on Mastodon. And different character count lengths and embedding support.

[^affordances]: [[Erin Kissane]] has been doing lots of writing and research about this, like her [Affordance Loop](https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop) article: ‚ÄúAffordances, in the simplest terms, are¬†_what an object offers or provides to a specific individual at a particular moment in time_.‚Äù

I‚Äôll continue to experiment across many different networks, servers, and protocols. I‚Äôll produce [[feeds]] from here. I‚Äôll look to own my accounts and data, and continue [[pooling capital and collaboration]] to work with others.
