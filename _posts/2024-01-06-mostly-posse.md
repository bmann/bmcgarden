An overview of my social accounts and posting. It can be summarized as mostly [[POSSE]].[^overload]

This started as a short post to put directly into a single Mastodon post about my three Mastodon accounts, but kind of got out of hand, so now it‚Äôs a blog post.

* I use [@boris@cosocial.ca](https://cosocial.ca/@boris) as my main Mastodon account. It receives cross-posts from my [personal blog](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com). Food photos, local Vancouver adventures, travel.

* [@boris@fission.social](https://fission.social/@boris) is my work account - decentralized compute [@everywherecomputer@fission.social](https://fission.social/@everywherecomputer), [[IPFS]] and protocol discussions

* [@boris@toolsforthought.social](https://toolsforthought.social/@boris) is hooked up to my [journal posts](https://bmannconsulting.com/journal/). The journal items also get cross-posted to [@bmannconsulting.com on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bmannconsulting.com)

My <https://bmann.ca> landing page links to all my social accounts[^all], and [@bmann.ca is also my Bluesky username](https://bsky.bmann.ca).

[^all]: Technically not all of them. I have Instagram and Facebook accounts that I don‚Äôt use. I have a Swarm/Foursquare account. Maybe I will eventually list _all_ my accounts for completeness üòÖ

I used [[Bluesky]] a lot in the early days, less so now. I‚Äôm more interested in [[ATProtocol]] than any particular network built with it, and am also interested in their [[DID]] based user ID system. 

My third Bluesky account is for my [[FoodWiki]] and is [@foodwiki.bmann.ca](https://bsky.app/profile/foodwiki.bmann.ca). For a change of pace, it has no automation and nothing cross posts to it! I hand post food pictures and recipes that I put on my FoodWiki. In part I made that a Bluesky account because many Mastodon users expect Content Warnings (CW) on things like food pictures.

I still have a Twitter account, but only use it for cross-posting to. The [[Twitter]] note page here also details my archive.

I have a [[Farcaster]] account and access that protocol through the [[Warpcast]] app.

[Tech Blog](https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/) posts I‚Äôm not auto cross posting. In part because they come across as just title plus link without any context in [[Micro.blog]]‚Äôs feed cross posting. Until I relaunched this site over the holidays, my long form tech blogging had effectively lapsed. We‚Äôll see what the year brings!

[[Fedica]] is a commercial service that does cross posting that I‚Äôm experimenting with for sharing blog posts.

The Fedica model supports 8 accounts even at the free account tier, which is great! But, even at paid tiers, you can only use one account per network, so right away it doesn‚Äôt support my three Mastodon accounts. And yeah, I have a pile of company and project accounts I run for work on the [Fission Mastodon Server](https://fission.social/@fission). 

There‚Äôs a whole other discussion to be had here about the affordances of each network[^affordances] that fights against cross-posting. No hashtags on Bluesky or Micro.blog. No quote posting on Mastodon. And different character count lengths and embedding support.

[^affordances]: [[Erin Kissane]] has been doing lots of writing and research about this, like her [Affordance Loop](https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop) article: ‚ÄúAffordances, in the simplest terms, are¬†_what an object offers or provides to a specific individual at a particular moment in time_.‚Äù

I‚Äôll continue to experiment across many different networks, servers, and protocols. I‚Äôll produce [[feeds]] from here.

I‚Äôll look to own my accounts and data, and continue [[pooling capital and collaboration]] to work with others. 

[^overload]: And overload! Yes I realize this is a lot of accounts and protocols and platforms to experiment with. The last time it was this dense was the mid 2000s. This time around, I‚Äôm hoping we can end up in more interoperable protocols, with my hope being that [ActivityPub and ATProtocol](https://bmannconsulting.com/blog/2024/01/05/why-not-both-protocols/) are both solid foundations for the next generation of not just social networks, but many apps.
