As I'm sitting here manually adding blocks of "break" time to my calendar around meetings I've booked, I'm getting a little frustrated.

I've used [Tungle](http://tungle.me) for several years now, and it's quite a good tool. Rather than playing the are-you-free-on-Wednesday dance (or as I like to call it, "Calendar Tetris") with multiple people, you can quickly find time when everyone is free to meet.

I've been worried about Tungle since they were bought by <acronym title="Research in Motion - makers of the BlackBerry smartphone">RIM</acronym>. A bit of a face lift, but nothing much in the way of new features, and certainly no communications or marketing (the [blog](http://www.tungle.me/Home/blog/) is frozen in time, to the date of the acquisition in May 2011). I think this a *great* ecosystem tool for BlackBerry - it addresses a core function of their user base: business users going to meetings.

Since I find what Tungle does very useful, I've started to look around for other calendaring / meeting tools that can solve Calendar Tetris.

I tried [Boomerang Calendar](http://boomerangcalendar.com/) for a bit, but it just copy-pastes free slots into email. That still puts the effort on me to juggle different slots in my calendar, and frankly the cut/paste is not that much of a win.

[Adam Kalsey](http://twitter.com/akalsey) pointed out [TimeBridge](http://timebridge.com) to me (acquired by MerchantCircle in 2010, no news on blog since then - uh oh). I've worked with it a little bit, but the fact that their [meetwith.me](http://meetwith.me) domain is showing as expired AND hosted on GoDaddy doesn't inspire confidence.

What I want is a calendaring agent. An agent that I can program to automatically add 30 minutes of blocked off time on either side of a meeting. A software agent that can know I prioritize meetings with significant others, paying clients, and long-time mentors. I'm seeing tools like [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) or [Cloudsnap](http://cloudsnap.com) arise that let us program some of the many tools at our disposal. But I don't want to program. I want an agent that learns from me, and improves automatically.

As my friend [Alen](http://www.alenpuaca.com/) likes to say, think about __Surface vs. Purpose__. The Surface: organizing meetings. The Purpose: staying organized and efficient, and living a life where you get more of the right things done.

I would love to hear suggestions for other tools that solve the Purpose aspect of calendaring. For now, you can find my availability online at [tungle.me/boris](http://tungle.me/boris).

### Update August 25th, 2013

Tungle is dead. There are no replacements that come close.

Gmail lets you [insert calendar invitations](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/161776?hl=en), which doesn't solve the let's-find-a-time-to-meet dance, but it's part of the offensive technique I've developed in suggesting a time that I know is free for me. This sometimes shortcuts the back and forth if it works for the other person.

At [Full Stack](http://fullstack.ca), I set aside [office hours most Thursdays](http://ohours.org/borismann), using a tool called [Ohours](http://ohours.org). This at least has the benefit that I have known time slots I can point people towards, who can then pick the time that fits them.
