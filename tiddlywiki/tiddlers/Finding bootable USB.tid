title: Finding bootable USB

Finally switched over to searching using Google and found [[How to Create Windows 10 Bootable USB on Mac with or without Bootcamp]].

Used [[UNetbootin]] -- but Disk Utility doesn't think it's bootable, so may need to try again.

Also hooked up the [[OWC Mercury Elite Pro Dock]] to see if I can install Windows on it and boot from there.
