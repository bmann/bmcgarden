via [@rosano](https://twitter.com/rosano/status/1343891364623380480), the people behind [[Ghost]] are putting together [Open Subscription Platforms](https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/):

> A shared movement for independent subscription data.
> With everyone getting into subscriptions, itâ€™s never been more important to be in control of your customer data.

And in the footer:

> An open standards working group committed to data portability for independent subscription platforms

This is mainly about data exports, not [[platform risk]] -- so no discussion about open source here. I thought [[Ghost]] and [[Substack]] were pretty rivalrous, but Substack is listed right there as well.

[[Medium]], [[Patreon]], and [[ConvertKit]] get specifically called out as closed platforms.
