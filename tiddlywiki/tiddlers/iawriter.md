What is iA Writer? A powerful Markdown editor app for iOS, MacOS, and Windows.

> It can be used without reading long manuals. Just open the app and start typing. Introduced with the original iA Writer in 2010, **Focus Mode** blinds everything out except the sentence or paragraph you are working on.| Write one sentence or paragraph at a time. When you said what you feel, edit. We have you covered there as well.

iA Writer has a [[Micropub]] publishing feature.

With [[IndieKit]] I can publish posts of type 'Article' to this site. Since the Micropub 'Note' post type doesn't have a title, I can't use it as a note unless I'm OK with date-stamp-as-title notes.

It also has [[Micro.blog]] support included.
