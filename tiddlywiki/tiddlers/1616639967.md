I'm finding it pleasant to flesh out [[Moa Party]] pages on the [website](https://moaparty.com/). It's small, and it's a constrained area of knowledge. The [notes graph](https://moaparty.com/notes/) is fun to look at.

I worked on the Pleroma]and ActivityPub pages, which was fun learning a bit more about those two things and gathering links and descriptions.
