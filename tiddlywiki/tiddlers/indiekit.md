From the [Github README](https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit):
> Indiekit is a small but powerful server that acts as the go-between your website and the wider independent web.
> * Publish content to your website using apps like [[iAWriter]], [[Micro.blog]], Icro, Indigenous or services that support the [[Micropub]] API
> * Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter, ~~Mastodon and LinkedIn~~, and save posts to the Internet Archive
> * ~~Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content with Webmention~~
> * Save files to different content stores such as Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab and Gitea
> * Highly configurable, with presets available for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.
> * Localisable, with initial support for English, French and German.
