This will document how this site gets connected to @Flancian's [[Anagora]] at the git repo level. 

As of [[January 24th, 2021]], @flancian connected the [bmann/bmcgarden](https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden) git repo into the [[Agora]].

I agree to [the contract of the agora](https://anagora.org/@agora/contract). I may create a [[Contract]] of my own in the future.
