I asked about this specifically for [[TiddlyWiki on NodeJS]] in the Talk TW forum: https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/pre-release-version-of-tiddlywiki-npm-package/753


<<<
Iâ€™m just getting back to working with TW on NodeJS. I have the 5.1.23 version of the npm package installed.

Is there a pre-release version of the npm package?

What is the expected way to install a pre-release version?
