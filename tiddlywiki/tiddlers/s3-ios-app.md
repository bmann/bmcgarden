I previously wrote about using an app called The Archivist for iOS photo backups. Iâ€™ve also used [[Dropshare]] in the past. Neither are working for me at the moment, and this paid app with a 1-Star rating is actually very good and simple for the task of uploading and downloading files to your [[AmazonS3]] buckets. [[Recommended]]!
