<p>Yes, it’s a new <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable “paper” tablet</a>. I’m using it in the hopes of better deep reading and writing.</p>

<p>Except for a quick microblog to post a picture of it!</p>

## Specs

@doriantaylor asked about the dimensions. It's 187 x 246 x 4.7 mm, active screen portion is 10.3”, 1872 x 1404 resolution, 226DPI. Full [technical specifications](https://remarkable.com/#Specifications).

## Templates

Anton @theunfoldingway asked if it supports custom templates. I had just discovered the [regular templates for notes](https://support.remarkable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002674558-Templates).

Doing a quick search found all these [for sale custom templates](https://www.einkpads.com/), and an app to load them onto your device. But, there are lots of open source tools to help with this.

This video shows how to create and add custom templates on [[Windows]]:
