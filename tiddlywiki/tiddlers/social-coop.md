From the [wiki](https://wiki.social.coop/home.html):

> **What?:** Social.coop is is an experiment in user-controlled social media. It is a community hub for people interested in co-ops and development of free/libre social media - these define the common core field of discussion, though they are far from the only things discussed.
>
>We primarily run a [[Mastodon]] social media server: one node in the [[Fediverse]], a federated network of social media applications which communicate using the [[Activity Pub]] and [[OStatus]] protocols.
>
> **Why?:** What distinguishes us from most other social media there is that we are both funded and governed by our members: we are a co-operative. The organisation and running of the site is accountable to its members, and not only will we not be monetising our users by selling their data to third parties, but they decide what we do.

https://social.coop is the home page for the Mastodon server. I'm a member, my Mastodon account is [@bmann@social.coop](https://social.coop/@bmann).

[[Open Collective]] is what they use to collect funds https://opencollective.com/socialcoop.

They use [[Loomio]] for organizational discussion and decision making https://www.loomio.org/socialcoop/
