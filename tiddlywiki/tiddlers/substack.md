Substack is a publishing and paid subscription platform. It is most often thought of for newsletters, but it's more of a combination newsletter + blogging platform.

It is a fully hosted, proprietary, free to start platform. They charge 10% of fees you collect.

As of October 2020, you can pay $50 one-time to add a [custom domain](https://blog.substack.com/p/new-add-a-custom-domain-to-your-substack).

[[Ghost]] has a [Ghost vs. Substack](https://ghost.org/vs/substack/) page that goes into more detail to consider.

My personal recommendation if you're going to use Substack, is to use it with a custom domain. Then, all the links going to your content are portable should you switch platforms later.
