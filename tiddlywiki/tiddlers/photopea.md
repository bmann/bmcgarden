Photopea, online photo editor

Works with Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, raw files, and most image formats. Not fully open source, free with ads or $40 / year. Works [[offline]] after first load. Available as a [[PWA]], great for using on a [[Chromebook]]. I use it on [[MacOS]] rather than having anything from the Adobe suite installed.
