Toolkit for building rich-text editors on the web. Developed by [[The Guardian]] and others. 

> An ideal content editor produces structured, semantically meaningful documents, but does so in a way that is easy for users to understand. ProseMirror tries to bridge the gap between Markdown text editing and classical WYSIWYG editors.

Very interesting phrase right on the home page about the [[Open Source]] nature ([[MIT License]]) of the code:

> If you are using ProseMirror to make profit, there is a **social** expectation that you help fund its maintenance. [Start here](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/fund/)

ProseMirror is maintained by [[Marijn Haverbeke]], whose page the _Start here_ links to.

The Guardian article on [moving from their previous editor Scribe to ProseMirror](https://www.theguardian.com/info/2019/jan/24/leaving-scribe) is also a good read.
