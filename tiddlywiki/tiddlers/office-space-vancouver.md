_Co-working, shared spaces, and offices for small teams_

_Ported from Frontier Community, originally created end of 2018_

I am looking for office space in Vancouver. 

Ideally I want an enclosed office that can fit 2 - 3 people. This might be a small standalone space (eg Dominion Building or similar) or it could be inside a shared space. 

The enclosed office is for 1) storing stuff -- including external monitor 2) frequent calls / video conferences. 3) not being in an open plan space

Nice to have:
* kitchen access
* whiteboards / bigger meeting rooms 

Open to something creative.

Turns out they are also behind the Spaces brand above.

More old-school office provider, specializes in enclosed offices. Multiple locations around Vancouver, vary in price.

2 - 3 person office is around $1000 per month, month to month, with some deposits and other items required at signing.

@boris:
_We had a 2 person office (with three keys) at 1066 W Hastings on the 20th floor through Regus. It was easy to share the space with other people, you can have people come by, you can get packages delivered._

_There was a "community space" -- whiteboard, table with four chairs -- that could be booked daily for up to 2 hours. You can only book it day of, so get up early and you should have no problem getting it -- but isn't ideal for booking ahead of time. We never booked a paid boardroom_

_After hours (eg small meetup) not really possible -- as the larger spaces are not available outside of business hours._

### [[Freespace]]

Use restaurants that are closed during the day as work space. $99CAD / month for pretty much unlimited 9am-5pm usage, plus coffee/tea included. Other pricing available. Tell them Boris referred you.
