My own blog post, originally on Medium and now permanently on my microblog:

> vNotes: A note sync format across devices & systems
> 
> Today we have [[vCards]] for person & business contact data, and [[CardDAV]] for syncing and sharing. For calendar data we have [[vCal]] and [[CalDAV]].
>
> This means that CRMs, for example, can link data to your calendar and your contacts. Any changes can get synced to the native contacts and calendar in your phone or calendar.
>
> But what about notes?
