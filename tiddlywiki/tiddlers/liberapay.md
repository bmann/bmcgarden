About page:

> Liberapay is a way to donate money recurrently to people whose work you appreciate.
> 
> Payments come with no strings attached. You don't know exactly who is giving to you, and donations are capped at CA$150.00 per week per donor to dampen undue influence.
> 
> By default, the total amount you give and the total amount you receive are public (you can opt out of sharing this info).
>
> Liberapay does not take a cut of payments, the service is funded by the donations to its own account. However there are payment processing fees.
> 
> Liberapay is an open project, you can help us translate it, improve its code, and manage its legal entity. If you do so you'll be able to join the Liberapay team and receive a share of the money that our users donate to keep the service running.
