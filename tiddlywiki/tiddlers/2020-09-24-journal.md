## Hiring Software Engineers

Bumped into @JasonMcLaren while out getting coffee from @Coho and had the exact same discussion around jobs and where to post them that isn't LinkedIn (which is pretty pointless for software jobs). The question about what network or platform to post to comes up all the time when I challenge people on wasting their time with LI.

@AngelList is still the one where I get the best results -- that is, I can post jobs there and get a decent flow of decent candidates automatically. And that's on their free tier -- they now have paid tiers starting at $250 per month.

@StackOverFlow I have heard good things about their job posting board. Their [talent page](https://stackoverflow.com/talent/en) doesn't have pricing, I believe last I heard it's like $4KUSD for a promoted listing.

Also: my standard advice: if you're considering paying recruiters, just hire a full time marketing / operations / chief of staff / people position instead, and have them work on running your sourcing and hiring.

### Social Mentions

OK, I'm going to see about building [[Social Mentions]] into the site as well.
