## Art Gallery and Downtown

Rachael and I actually slept in a bit (for us) and had breakfast at home, and then went out to the Vancouver Art Gallery.

I spent a lot of the week only being indoors, on way too many Zoom calls.

You need to book an appointment ahead of time, and have to wear a mask in the gallery. There were maybe 4 other people we encountered wandering around during our booking slot. 

The Victor Vasarely exhibition -- pop art -- was amazing. I [posted on social.coop](https://social.coop/@bmann/105210203333395681), including a painting that matches Rachael's new sweater. We'll see if I get around to posting more research and photos about Vasarely later.

Then we went to The Bay. Much more crowded and feeling uncomfortable, although masks are required. Bought a 9x13" baking pan, and a quarter sheet with a grill/tray that will be for roasting various things.

I suggested Miku for lunch. Yes, a bit high end and pricey -- but very delicious. Reflecting on how lucky and privileged we are to do things like this occasionally.
