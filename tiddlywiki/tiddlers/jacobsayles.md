[[Vancouver]]-based. [[Coworking]] expert. [[Python]] developer.

> I am a creative and entrepreneurial technologist with over 20 years of experience and a history of innovative ideas, well executed projects, and management of diverse teams. In 2007, I recognized the growing trend of independent and remote workers and opened Office Nomads, the first coworking space in Seattle, WA. To support this business and others like it, I wrote Nadine, the first open source coworking platform, and founded Open Coworking, a non-profit dedicated to the Coworking Movement. In 2016 I relocated to Vancouver, Canada to take on the role of Director of Technology for 312 Main, a 105,000 sf coworking community in the old Downtown Vancouver Police building.
