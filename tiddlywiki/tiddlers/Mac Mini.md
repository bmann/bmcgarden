I bought a Mac Mini[^macmini2018] on [October 3rd, 2022]].

I got the higher end model and bumped the processor to the **3.2GHz 6‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i7**, but everything else base -- 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD.

[^macmini2018]: This is known as the Mac Mini (2018) edition. The [Apple Mac Mini page](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) now lists the new Mac Mini with the [[Apple M1]] ARM chip.

I have often used Norse Mythology as a naming scheme for computers, although I'm also currently using a Pokemon theme for portable devices. This current Mac Mini is named _Utgard_.[^utgard]

[^utgard]: See [Útgarðar on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Atgar%C3%B0ar), where you can follow many other Norse mythology references

The rest of my home desktop setup:

* 32GB of RAM [ordered from OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/2666DDR4S32P/); the saga of the screwdrivers means that I didn't complete installation until [Feb 2021](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/2021/02/09/i-bought-this.html)
* [[eGPU]] enclosure from Razer, with an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card with 8GB RAM
* [[Asus VG289Q Monitor]] 28" 4K monitor
* Logitech M535 Bluetooth mouse
* HyperX membrane keyboard: quieter, full size, and permanently wired, so my [[Royal Kludge]] becomes my wireless / portable keyboard. Don't worry, it still has rainbow backlighting!
* 2TB NVMe drive in an external enclosure, [researched originally Nov 14th, 2020]({% link _logs/2020-11-14-journal.md %}), purchased and installed [Nov 24th, 2020]({% link _logs/2020-11-24-journal.md %})
* OWC Mercury Elite Pro Dock with 2x 2TB SSD drives (installed [[February 9th, 2021]]); the fan is very loud, so unplugged for now?
* Webcam, [detailed Nov 7th, 2020, along with eGPU purchase]({% link _logs/2020-11-07-journal.md %})
* Yeti Blue USB Microphone, which I also plug my Sennheiser Headset into


To research:
* Wired headphones and digital amp
* Wrist rest? I have to get the position / height of my hands, the desk, and keyboard set correctly
* Kneeling chair? The office chair is pretty good, but I'm spending a LOT of time in this room
