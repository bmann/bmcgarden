[^macrumors]: from this [MacRumors thread](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/best-egpu-for-mac-mini-2020.2253096/), which has more to say: <blockquote>I assure you that the Sonnet eGFX Breakaway Box 650 and the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 580 card combination is an effortless no-brainer on the Macs and Windows 10 PCs I have tried.</blockquote>
