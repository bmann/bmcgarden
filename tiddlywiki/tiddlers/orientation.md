Rails app to create internal docs & tutorials for an organization. Has [[Deploy to Heroku]] support, uses Google Auth for login, can group articles as lists to make Guides.[[We're using a <a href='{% link _notes/discourse.md %}'>Discourse forum</a> for this at Fission, and I'd probably recommend Discourse for this use case now.::lmn]]

The [Purpose & Features page](https://github.com/orientation/orientation/blob/master/doc/FEATURES.md) has extended info.
