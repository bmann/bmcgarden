title: Agora FAQ
---

I realize that while this site is connected into [[Anagora]] (but that’s an instance, so I should be saying [[Agora]] instead?) that I don’t really know how it works! Or what the special features are!

## What markup do I use to link to a “global” node? A particular user’s node?

For instance, this post will be imported there, under “my” node. How does someone, while writing in their agora, link to [[Agora FAQ]]?

Ideally I don’t want to have to break my flow and go look up a link. So, within some bounds of acceptable markup across different agora engines *and* their plain text representation in Git, what should this look like?

## What Markdown features are supported? What non-Markdown features do I need to know about?

Footnotes are not (currently) supported. See my [[Goggles]] node [in the agora](https://anagora.org/node/goggles) for footnote examples. 

## What engines are supported? What engines do people currently run?

Anything whose source is Markdown pages in Git can be imported.

_This is clearly a collaborative doc that should probably be an EtherPad linked to the Agora FAQ page_
