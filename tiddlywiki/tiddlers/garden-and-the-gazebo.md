title: Garden and the Gazebo
---

My current setup for this site I'm calling the **Garden and the Gazebo**.[^colophon]

[^colophon]: The [[Colophon]] has the history of the site and some other setup details, for which the TLDR really is [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]] for the public portion, and [[LogSeq]] for the private portion.

The **Garden** is what you're looking at and browsing: inter-linked notes, the portion of my [[Second Brain]] that I keep public.

The **Gazebo** is where I keep my private notes. A day-to-day [[Worklog]], TODOs, notes from meetings, and various notes to self.

## Garden

I haven't used my root `bmannconsulting` domain for things for a while. The [[Archive]] has 12 years of lightly pruned blog posts. I ran a separate wiki for a while, mostly about food and travel, but it was very useful for notes on [[ChromeOS]] and other non-food things, so the Garden is back to being a wiki-like interface for notes, concepts, and other snippets that aren't blog posts.

Calling it a garden because it's organic, messy, sprawling, and where things grow. It's also an area that people can "walk around in", much like a physical garden.

Wikis have fallen out of fashion these days, although their concepts in tools like [[Notion]] are perhaps bigger than ever. "wiki gardening" is a term that I've used and an activity I've practiced in the past, so that fits, too.

[[Ton Zijlstra]] wrote about his own digital notes on his blog as [Planting the Garden of Forking Paths](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/07/planting-the-garden-of-forking-paths/).[^borges]

[^borges]: Yes, that refers to the [short story by Borges (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths).

[[Processing]] is where I'm stashing articles I intend to quote and keep and other snippets of information. I've got [[Working Copy]] on my phone, so I can copy / paste information and check it in. Right now, I have to get back to my computer to publish it, which isn't ideal.

## Gazebo

Maybe locked garden shed would be another analogy, but Gazebo is what popped into my mind and what I'm running with.

I am mostly in the Gazebo, using [[LogSeq]], day-to-day. 

I can't seamlessly move from private to public.

## Blog posts vs Notes

What's the difference between a blog post and a note? When I say it like that, it seems simple. But, this note is a great example. I'm writing it for myself -- to figure out what I think -- and I'm writing it in public, so I can share it and point people at it when they ask about my setup.

But a blog post would never make it public in this shape. I'm playing with using the [[WIP]] tag -- for myself, so I can know which notes need some more work. Which is kind of like the [[Processing]] page, too. Lots of loose ends, but in a good way.
