A [[Serverless]] email server on AWS using [[AmazonS3]] and [[AmazonSES]].

git: https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447_product_s3_email

"an unmanaged email server with unlimited email addresses that also offers the benefit of easily organizing messages by adding the + character to the email names. The + is converted to a /, which correlates to an object path in S3."
