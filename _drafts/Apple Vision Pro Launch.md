As someone who dove deep into XR 8 years ago, we’ve _known_ that Apple had this coming. All of their UI and UX evolutions have been part of it. 

Hand and eye interactions of XR interfaces aka spatial computing is THE interface.

This is the first device that brings a lot of complex, highly dense tech together. Which Apple has shown they can do really well. 

It’s about the same price as full VR rigs (beefy machine + mounted sensors, wands, etc), as an all in one.

This is not the device to replace a phone. It replaces a fully loaded MacBook Pro for certain professionals who will find this invaluable. It even has Pro in the name. The Vision and Vision Air will be less expensive versions over time.
