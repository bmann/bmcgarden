Fission announced [last week](https://talk.fission.codes/t/farewell-from-fission-fission/5358) that Fission is winding down.[^thirdperson]

[^thirdperson]: I mean, it was technically me that wrote and published that post. Company voice is weird!

But aside from a ventured-funded Canadian company, Fission is and always has been people.

The community of people exists around the [Discord chat](https://fission.codes/discord), the working groups around standards and protocols, the other protocol ecosystems like IPFS, Filecoin, CASA, the Protocol Labs Network, code repositories, events like Causal Islands and IPFS Connect, and endless more organizations and collaborators and gathering spaces.

Fission as a company and a name went through a bunch of twists and turns, technically starting out as an open source project that [[Brooklyn Zelenka]] worked on in the Ethereum community. Yes, we've been attempting to build a world computer for a long time!

The registered name Fission Internet Software Services for InterOperable Networks Inc.[^typo] is of course a recursive acronmyn.

[^typo]: OK, well, between me and the lawyer it ended up as Fission Internet Software Services for Open Networks Inc. Yes, it's missing an "I". And, we did a DBA of Fission Internet Software because the long form breaks a bunch of important forms 😅

We ended up with `fission.codes` as the main domain. And with `@FissionCodes` as the Twitter handle. So people often called us "Fission Codes". Not wrong.

So: Fission's Idea Space: Shared Interest Organic Network
