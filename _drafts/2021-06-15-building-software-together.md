I am proposing that we build software together.

Yes, I mean open source, of course. But more than that.

I want to say that we can build software _together_. Not developers and makers off in one corner, and people who use the app off in another.

This means a couple of things. It means ownership. It means agency. It means not just


But we're going to have to change the way this works. We're going to need to change the licenses formerly known as open source.

It's great that as a developer who has a well paid day job, you scratch an itch on evening and weekends by making a project or two. No really, it's fantastic!

I'm a mediocre developer. And a mediocre product lead. But I have ideas.



But what does that even mean, here in 2021? I fought in the Microsoft <acronym title="Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt">FUD</acronym> wars in the early 2000s, and we won! Well, the corporations won, again, mostly. And many of the open source flag bearers now throw FUD at new licenses. It was good enough for them, why would we want to go and change things?





The first one is [[Moa Party]][^lastblog] -- a Python-based service run as a public utility
