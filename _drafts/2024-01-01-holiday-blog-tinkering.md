I'm finalizing the very small amount of holiday blog tinkering on the first day of 2024. I used the new journal post type to write up some extended notes over at [January 1st, 2024](/journal/2024-01-01/).

I don't know that I'm going to write more blog posts in 2024 (but hey! here's a first one!), but I do enjoy having note pages / landing pages where I can collect information and refer people to it. So one of the things I did was add a [Cloudron page](/notes/cloudron/).

I'd love to self host an IndieKit install on my own Cloudron -- it's a very small NodeJS server
